# Changelog

All notable changes to `Integrity engine` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
See [`docs/03-versioning.md`](docs/03-versioning.md) for our versioning policy — it matters
because **we are our own first customers** and pin exact engine versions in our games.

## [Unreleased]

- **New scene: `/ground.html` (docs/55)** — a regolith ground world rendered from
  `/worlds/ground/world.json`. Every world number is in the file (size, relief, strata, camera, gravity,
  grain size); the scene supplies a camera rig, a "Drop meteor" button and three passes. Procedural
  material textures from cited optical properties; sky derived from the declared atmosphere.
  **The camera is MATTER** — a transparent shell on the shared `granular::terrain_contact_resolve`,
  replacing the clamp; its half-extent ≥ near-clip so the frustum cannot cross the surface.
  **Known gap:** the crater refills, because the CPU `MatterSim::step` has no grain-grain contact so
  ejecta cannot form a blanket. Next: step these grains on the GPU granular container.

- **The surface is data (docs/54).** `world_def::GroundSurface` declares patch size, fbm octaves, relief
  band, sea level and material strata; `world::generate_from` builds it; `Simulation` uses it.
  **Output-neutral** — the declared defaults are voxel-identical to the old hardcoded patch, asserted by
  test, with the converse asserted per dial. `world::terrain_height_with` is the declared-relief form;
  `terrain_height`/`generate` remain as shims on the defaults.
- **Mistyped definition keys are refused** (`deny_unknown_fields` on the ground/impact schema). serde
  ignores unknown fields by default, so a typo silently ran a different world than the file described.
- **`run-definition` accounts for every grain** — created / returned to voxels / in flight / **lost
  off-patch** — because "0 particles" cannot distinguish de-resolution (matter conserved) from the
  off-patch cull (matter deleted). Measured: 96 m patch 0.0% lost, 48 m patch 28.8% (ledger row 9).

- **The engine runs from a DEFINITION (docs/53).** New `engine::simulation::Simulation` builds the voxel
  world, the shared `MatterSim` and the `ResolutionField` from a `"ground"` world and steps them — no
  scene struct, no canvas, no `wasm_bindgen`. New `GroundDef`/`GroundEvent` schema (`impact`, `ejecta`),
  `definitions/ejecta-ground.json`, and a headless `run-definition` binary that also reports the solid-voxel
  delta so de-resolution (matter conserved) is distinguishable from the off-world cull (matter lost).
  **Closes docs/46 ledger row 15** — the systems deleting terrain orphaned have a production consumer
  again, and it is a file rather than a scene.

- **The engine can acquire a GPU with no browser (docs/52).** New `engine::gpu_host::GpuHost::headless()`
  (native only) and **target-specific wgpu backends** — WebGPU for wasm32, wgpu's defaults (Vulkan on
  Linux) elsewhere. Target tables rather than a cargo feature, because features unify across a build graph
  and targets do not, so a native backend cannot leak into the browser build. Adapter selection is
  explicit (`INTEGRITY_ADAPTER`), filters out CPU fallbacks, and **refuses to guess** when several GPUs
  are present. Verified on hardware: RTX 5060 Ti over Vulkan compiling the shipping `sph_step.wgsl`.
  **The browser build is unchanged** (wasm + wasm-pack clean, both scenes rig-verified).

- **Birth of the Moon is a DATA world (docs/51).** New `"impact"` world type (`world_def::ImpactDef`) +
  `/worlds/birth/world.json` + `OrbitDemo::load_impact_world`. The giant impact's initial conditions —
  body radii, softening, core-resolution factor, approach speed (×v_esc), start separation, impact
  parameter, proto-target spin, relax separation — are declared in the file instead of compiled in. The
  LAWS stay in the engine. **Output-neutral:** every default is the constant it replaced, asserted by test.
  `gpu_sph::build_far_apart_from` / `assemble_from_relaxed_with` take the def; the old names remain as
  shims on the declared defaults.
- **docs/46 ledger row 14 NARROWED** (scene instances were already data; one scene was compiled in) and
  **row 15 ADDED** — deleting terrain left `MatterSim`, `ResolutionField` and the voxel `World` with ZERO
  production consumers, and the granular pipeline reachable only from a compute-only diagnostic.

- **One GPU particle container (docs/50).** `crate::gpu_store::ParticleStore<T>` holds the particle
  buffer, capacity/count, `append`/`replace`, and the two-phase async read-back for BOTH the granular and
  SPH pipelines; each previously carried its own byte-for-byte copy. Solvers unchanged (docs/46 §1).
  `GpuParticles::count`/`readback_count` are now methods, not public fields.
- **The terrain scene (`Engine`) is REMOVED** — the first scene designed, superseded. `terrain.html`,
  `src/main.ts`, the vite entry, the nav link and 25 terrain-only rigs go with it. `lib.rs` 5,548 → 3,794.
  `engine::Engine` is no longer exported; `OrbitDemo` and `Terra` remain.
- **docs/46 ledger row 14** — a scene is engine code, not data: deleting one cost 1,516 lines inside the
  engine crate plus a public-API change, when it should have been deleting a description.
- **`scripts/rig.sh` gains `--restart` / `--stop`** and fixes three harness bugs: a self-matching `pkill`
  that killed the caller, a dev server that held the script's stdout open (hanging any piped invocation),
  and a vite invocation that served 404s while logging "ready".

- **`World::surface_top_voxel` is O(1)** — a cached per-column `tops` raster replaces an O(height)
  top-down scan that was **16.7% of the terrain frame**. Every `set_voxel` recomputes its own column, so
  the cache is exact by construction. **Output-neutral.** Measured: terrain 55.6 → 41.8 ms/frame
  (17.9 → 23.4 fps, 1.31×).
- **Rig harness: one launcher, one command.** `web/rig/_launch.mjs` holds the Chromium flags for all 67
  rigs — critically `--disable-frame-rate-limit`, without which this headless setup paces every page at
  exactly 1 Hz and every fps measurement is meaningless. `scripts/rig.sh` starts Xorg, rebuilds wasm only
  when Rust/WGSL changed, and forces a vite restart after any rebuild (the stale-wasm trap).

- **Video rig — smoothness and continuity.** `scripts/rigvideo.sh <rig>.mjs` records the composited
  screen losslessly while a rig runs; `scripts/analyze_motion.py` reports freeze %, delivered fps, worst
  hitch, discontinuity jumps and steadiness, with `--selftest` controls (known smooth / stuttery /
  frozen) to read them against. **Correction (2026-07-21):** its first reported finding — "terrain and
  birth deliver ~1 fps" — was a HARNESS ARTIFACT, not the engine. Chromium paces this headless setup at
  exactly 1 Hz without `--disable-frame-rate-limit`. True rates: terra ~354, birth ~52, terrain ~23 fps.

- **`crate::render`** — the scene-agnostic render scaffolding (`GpuMesh`, `UniformSlot`, `Camera`, the
  uniform PODs, `DEPTH_FORMAT`, and the generic buffer/mesh/depth helpers) lifted out of
  `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")] mod app`. All three scenes used these identically. **Behavioural
  change: none.** lib.rs 5,684 → 5,548. Completes the three mechanical lifts (`gpu_sph`,
  `gpu_particles`, `render`); what remains in `mod app` is genuinely per-scene.
- **docs/46 ledger row 13** — incandescence has two curves (`emission::incandescence` vs a private copy
  in the space band). Logged with evidence, not unified: it is a visual change needing its own verification.
- **New rig `web/rig/all_scenes.mjs`** — shoots terrain + birth + terra in one run with a blank-page
  control, for changes to shared render code where a single-scene check proves nothing.

- **`GpuParticles` is `crate::gpu_particles`** — the GPU particle container moved out of
  `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")] mod app` into a scene-agnostic module compiled on every target, and
  took its own configuration with it: `GRID_TABLE_SIZE`, `GRID_BUCKET_K` and `MAX_PARTICLES` are now the
  container's, not the terrain scene's. Sibling of `gpu_sph`, which is the precondition for hosting both
  pipelines on one allocator/render path (docs/33); the solvers stay specialized (docs/46 §1).
  **Behavioural change: none.** lib.rs 6,031 → 5,684.
- **New `WORKGROUP` constant, pinned to the shader.** `dispatch` mirrored `@workgroup_size(64)` with a
  bare literal in two places; a mismatch would silently under- or over-dispatch (under-dispatch = a tail
  of grains that never steps, with no error). Now named and checked against every `@compute` entry point
  in `particle_step.wgsl`.
- **New rig `web/rig/debris_container.mjs`** — exercises the container end to end in the live scene
  (meteor → append → step → readback → de-resolution), which a static terrain screenshot does not.

- **`gpu_sph` compiles natively; its shader layouts are pinned in-crate.** The module was
  `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` because of exactly one line — an `Rc<Cell<bool>>` in a `map_async`
  callback, which wgpu bounds by `WasmNotSend` (a no-op on wasm, `Send` elsewhere). Now
  `Arc<AtomicBool>`, so ~700 lines of shipping GPU host code are under `cargo check`/`cargo test` for the
  first time. New in-crate guards pin `SphParticle`/`SphEos`/`SphParams` to `sph_step.wgsl` field-for-field.
  **Behavioural change: none** — but `SphParams::_p0` is renamed **`omega`** to match the shader, which
  reads that slot as a rigid-rotation rate for `cs_relax`'s rotating-frame relaxation. Same bytes, same
  value (0.0); a consumer constructing `SphParams` literally must use the new field name.
- **The WGSL↔Rust layout checker is shared** — `wgsl_layout.rs` (test-only); `gpu_layout`'s private copy
  is gone. One parser pinned to every shader that has a Rust mirror.
- **Rigs take `PORT` (default 5173) and `OUT` (default `/tmp/rigshot`) from `rigshot.sh`.** Replaces 13
  hardcoded dead ports and a hardcoded dead scratchpad path in 30 rigs. `birth_shot.mjs` now defaults to
  the LOCAL dev server instead of the public site. `web/rig/README.md` records what these rigs are: one-off
  instruments, not a test suite.

- **The central resolution system — the Analytic → Resolved hand-off, inherent (docs/49).**
  `resolution::ResolutionField` holds active physics as analytic `Effect`s, propagates them by cheap math
  while off-camera, and materialises each one the frame it enters view — through the SHARED matter path
  (`MatterSim::spawn_region` for carried matter, e.g. a far-side impact's ejecta arriving), never a
  per-backend adapter. One `update()` call per frame is the entire wiring, identical for every scene. New
  `MatterSim::spawn_region` (deposit carried matter as grains, vs `materialize_region`'s excavation).
  Wired into the terrain `Engine` (`register_effect` feeds it; no sources registered yet, so live behaviour
  is unchanged). 3 field tests incl. the Moon lifecycle end to end.

- **The core resolution controller (docs/49) — `resolution::ResolutionController`, THREE modes.**
  Existence is the physics' (necessity/admission — an unwatched wheel still sinks); the camera chooses the
  REPRESENTATION. `ACTIVE-PHYSICS × IN-VIEW → {Bulk, Analytic, Resolved}`: no active physics ⇒ `Bulk`
  (rendered at camera LOD); active but off-camera ⇒ `Analytic` (cheap math, propagate the effects — a
  far-side Moon impact is here); active and in view ⇒ `Resolved` (particle sim + render) at the finer of
  camera and physics granularity. The camera never gates existence — active physics off-camera is never
  `Bulk`. One fidelity dial (`angular_resolution`). Decision logic only; not wired into a scene yet
  (docs/49 §5). 6 tests.

- **Quasi-static admission test (docs/44 §4b) — `resolution.rs`.** Sizes the region a resting/rolling load
  must resolve from the material's own yield: `resolved_depth(pressure, patch_radius, yield)` returns the
  depth the contact stress reaches yield (closed-form Boussinesq root), and **0 when the load is below
  yield** — a car on basalt resolves zero particles, exactly. Verified against docs/44's worked table
  (basalt 0, regolith 0.096 m, sand 0.409 m). The LAW only; nothing wires it into a scene yet. Boussinesq
  is a conservative sizing envelope, never a force law (flagged, docs/44 §4b).

- **Hierarchical spatial hash on the GPU (docs/47 §1) — grains of different size can now find each
  other.** `cell_size(level) = base_cell·2^level`, one table, level folded into the hash key; the force
  gather walks every populated level. `Params` gains `base_cell`/`max_level` with **no struct-size
  change** (reuses reserved padding; layout guards confirm). At `max_level = 0` — every live scene — the
  walk collapses to the old ±1 scan and output is **bit-identical** to the flat grid. `gpu-verify` gains a
  cross-level contact scene (G0) and a production-N mixed-size bench. **Measured limitation:** the
  multi-level gather is ~21× slower at 5 levels / N=60k (117 ms vs 5.5 ms uniform, RTX 5060 Ti), because a
  big grain must scan the fine level to find its neighbours; the fix (deterministic symmetric scatter) is
  scoped but not built, so mixed-size is correct-but-slow and gated off by default.

- **The GPU granular step is now RUN-TO-RUN DETERMINISTIC.** New `cs_grid_sort` pass orders each spatial-
  hash bucket by particle index between insert and force accumulation. `cs_grid_insert` took its slot from
  `atomicAdd`, so bucket order was decided by thread race; `cs_forces` summed contacts in that order and
  float addition is not associative, so identical input gave different output (measured: 7/174 grains
  diverging by up to 8.3e-5 m after 40 frames, amplifying to ~6% on `gpu-verify` scene E). The full
  `gpu-verify` suite is now **bit-identical across runs**, and gains scene **D0** which asserts it. This
  matters beyond tidiness: scene I is the fudge detector, and its tolerance was previously wider than its
  own reproducibility, so any regression smaller than the drift was invisible. Adds one dispatch per
  substep over the hash table — the same fixed shape as `cs_grid_clear`, and removable by the same
  occupied-cells-only fix.

- **GPU particles carry their own radius (docs/47 §1).** `Particle` grows 64 → 80 bytes with a
  per-particle `radius` (plus a reserved padded row). The shader now uses THIS grain's size wherever a
  global one was assumed — contact `touch = ri + rj`, headroom, terrain penetration, drag cross-section,
  the resting test — so `P.part_half`/`P.c_radius` no longer set per-grain behaviour. **Plumbing only:**
  the CPU still gives every grain the same radius, and mixed sizes need the hierarchical grid mirrored
  into WGSL first, since a flat grid's ±1-cell invariant breaks as soon as radii differ. Verified against
  the shader by both layout guards; `gpu-verify` shows no new scene failures (the one failure, scene D
  repose, fails identically on `main`), and the numeric difference is below the harness's own
  run-to-run noise.

- **NEW `grid` module — the hierarchical spatial hash (docs/47 §1).** Neighbour finding that does not
  assume one grain size: `cell_size(level) = base·2^level`, each item at the level whose cell is at least
  its own contact diameter, each pair enumerated exactly once by scanning own + COARSER levels only.
  Replaces the reasoning behind a single global `cell_size` — growing that cell to the largest grain
  survives a 2× ratio and collapses at 100× (a 1 m cell packed with 1 cm grains holds ~10⁶ of them, so a
  ±1-cell scan degenerates to O(N)). Cost follows NON-EMPTY levels with no cap; an unused level is an
  O(1) skip. `pairs_within` is the reference, **pinned to brute force by test** across a 100× size range
  and on a boulder-among-pebbles fixture. CPU reference only — the WGSL mirror is not written yet, and
  the live GPU path still uses the flat single-size grid.

- **Contact is now SIZE-AWARE and force-based — the prerequisite for multi-granularity (docs/47 §1).**
  `granular::contact_force` returns the FORCE on a grain (its partner receives exactly the negative), so
  grains of different size and mass each accelerate by `F/m` and **momentum is conserved exactly**. The
  old `contact_accel` returns a per-mass acceleration applied as `+a`/`-a`, which is correct only while
  every grain is identical: unequal masses make that unequal and opposite FORCES, manufacturing momentum
  at every contact. This retires the approximation the module header has flagged from the start
  ("we model all debris as equal-mass grains ... Per-material mass is a later refinement").
  Contact now begins at `ri + rj` rather than `2·radius`. Adds `granular::grain_radius_for`
  (docs/47's `L_contact / n_across` sizing rule) and `granular::effective_radius`. **Equal grains
  reproduce the existing law exactly** — asserted, so no existing scene changes answer. Pure law only:
  the GPU path still carries one grain size per dispatch.

- **BREAKING (API): `mesher::build_earth_cap` takes a `field: Option<&World>`.** Pass the world and the
  bulk cap follows the persistent T0 `displacement`, so a de-resolved crater renders as a crater instead
  of pristine relief. `None` keeps the old pure-procedural behaviour.
- **NEW `axle` module — the revolute joint (docs/47 §3).** Holds a wheel's hub on a chassis anchor while
  leaving rotation about ONE axis free, as a CONSTRAINT rather than a spring: a penalty joint stiff enough
  to hold a wheel on is also stiff enough to launch it. `axle::resolve` projects the hub back onto its
  anchor without writing velocity (zero injected energy), matches COM velocity as a reported impulse, and
  preserves spin about the axle axis exactly while refusing wobble. `axle::angular_velocity` recovers a
  particle cloud's spin from linear momenta alone (`ω = I⁻¹L`) — **no rotational degree of freedom is
  added anywhere**, so a force couple spins a wheel and the axle passes the torque through. Reactions are
  returned for the caller to apply to the chassis. No vehicle uses it yet.
- **FIX: demotion no longer strands the sea.** `column_is_bakeable` now refuses columns under water — a
  sea column has two surfaces (seabed and waterline) while the T0 field stores one height per column, so
  baking one recorded the seabed, freed the ground beneath, and left 1,514 water voxels floating. Adds
  `World::demote_patch_to_field` (atomic — a half-demoted patch cannot be rendered). Consequence worth
  knowing: whole-patch demotion cannot fire on a world with a sea (7.4% of columns wet, scattered across
  the patch), so per-column demotion is a prerequisite rather than a refinement.
- **One authoritative ground query — `World::ground_top_voxel`.** Returns a column's voxel top while it
  is resolved and the SAME top after it is demoted to the T0 field, so de-resolution is invisible to
  whoever asks where the ground is. The GPU grain heightfield, the CPU bilinear contact surface and the
  bulk cap all read it; previously those three disagreed, and demoting a column would have dropped grains
  through the floor and rendered the crater as untouched ground. Adds `World.demoted`, which separates
  "baked into the field" from "excavated to nothing" — a zero displacement cannot. Notably this needs
  **no sub-voxel heightfield**: the bake preserves an already-quantised surface, so the field returns the
  identical integer top and the GPU's `array<i32>` is untouched. Nothing triggers demotion yet; this
  makes it safe, not active.

- **BREAKING (API): `MatterSim::materialize_steep_terrain` drops its `steep_drop` argument.** Terrain
  stability is now Mohr–Coulomb — a face stands if friction holds the slope OR cohesion holds the bank —
  so there is no step-height threshold left to pass. Call sites just delete the trailing integer.
- **Terrain has a friction term (docs/45).** Slope stability implemented only cohesion
  (`h_crit = fracture_strength/ρg`) behind a constant that tolerated a 72° face for every material, while
  the grains have derived their angle of repose from `friction_coefficient` since docs/23. Ground and
  grain now answer the slope question with one law, `granular::face_stable`, reading the same DB datum.
  Cohesionless material (gravel, sand) can no longer stand a vertical face at any height but is stable as
  a slope at its own repose angle; **rock cliffs are unchanged and canyons do not flatten**. Stabilisation
  converges to a fixpoint instead of shedding grains without bound (measured: 106→622 grains/pass and
  rising, versus 0 on a second pass now), and undisturbed terrain is left alone (470 → 0 grains).
- **Slumped material no longer hangs inside the collision surface.** Faces are cut to their *stable*
  height rather than down to the neighbouring column, so grains come off the wedge above the resulting
  talus ramp: worst penetration against the bilinear surface 2.75 m → 0.50 m. Known limit, flagged as a
  resolution IOU: an integer heightfield cannot express a slope between 0° and 45°, so repose is enforced
  to within `1/r` over an `r`-cell baseline (~3.6° at the 8-cell default).
- **BREAKING (world schema): atmospheres declare MASS, not pressure.** `atmosphere.surface_pressure_pa`
  is removed; declare `atmosphere.mass_kg` (and optionally `composition`) and surface pressure is DERIVED
  as the weight of that column, `P = M·g/(4πR²)`. Earth's world file previously declared 101,325 Pa
  against an emergent 99,049 Pa, so Terra rendered a 2.2%-different atmosphere from the terrain and orbit
  scenes. One planet now has one atmosphere, and an airless world is just `mass_kg: 0.0`.
- **Drag is a force now, and `matter::DRAG` is gone.** The GPU particle step applies
  `a = ½ρ_air v² C_d/(ρ_grain·s)` against an air density derived from the planet's declared atmosphere
  mass; the `drag` multiplier uniform becomes `air_rho` (0 = vacuum). A grain's own density and size set
  how much the air can push it. Verified against hand calculation on hardware (10 → 9.976 m/s, predicted
  9.976), and a vacuum particle now keeps its speed exactly.
- **Air is now something to move through** — `atmosphere::air_density_at` (barometric profile, derived
  from the planet's *emergent* surface pressure, air's real molar mass and the verified `scale_height`)
  and `atmosphere::drag_accel` (quadratic `½ρv²C_dA`). Sea level reproduces 1.225 kg/m³; an airless body
  gets exactly zero drag.
- **T0 is now a persistent field** — `World.displacement` (a `w × d` raster) is added to the procedural
  relief, so terrain deformation can be baked back and PERSIST after its voxels are freed. Adds
  `demote_column_to_field`, `column_is_bakeable` (refuses columns with voids, which a heightfield cannot
  represent), and `World::from_voxels`. Untouched worlds are byte-identical to before. Substrate only —
  no caller yet.
- **NEW material: `rubber`** (tyre tread compound) — ρ=1150, E=7 MPa, ν=0.49 (nearly incompressible, so a
  contact patch spreads rather than compresses), μ=0.9, restitution 0.5, ductility 4.5. Deliberately
  carries **no `thermal` block**: rubber does not melt, it pyrolyses, so melt point has no honest value
  and `damage.rs` returns Fractured rather than claiming melt. μ is flagged in the datum as a first-order
  stand-in — real grip is hysteretic and falls with temperature and slip speed.
- **Bodies get real ground friction (traction)** — `Engine::collide_probe_with_terrain` now resolves
  against `granular::terrain_contact_resolve`, the same non-injecting constraint the GPU debris uses,
  replacing a tangential `vel *= 0.5` velocity multiply that was blind to normal load, μ and slope. μ is
  read from the terrain material's own datum, so ice (μ=0.05) and basalt (μ=0.7) now behave differently
  under a body. New `World::surface_bilinear_grad` supplies the surface gradient (hence the normal) that
  bounded Coulomb friction requires; `surface_height_bilinear` delegates to it, so one implementation.
  Also removes the `DEAD = 0.15` dead-zone hack, and derives the probe's bond damping from iron's own
  restitution (`granular::zeta_for_restitution`, factored out of `damping_for_restitution`) instead of a
  hardcoded ζ=0.4 that implied e≈0.254. **Behaviour change:** the probe now takes ~35 s to settle after a
  drop instead of ~6.5 s. The old figure was not a physical one — the removed `vel *= 0.5` was a
  ~50%-per-substep damper doing nearly all the settling work, so the lattice's real elastic ringing was
  suppressed rather than dissipated. Bonds stay intact
  (integrity 100%). Anything assuming a fast settle needs to cope with the longer transient.
- **VERIFIED ON METAL — iPad Pro (M4) and iPhone 15 Pro Max (A17 Pro)** — the granular GPU step
  produces the same physics on Metal as on Vulkan across all three devices (`tot = 1.585e+7`,
  `vmax = 30.945` at N=60,000; `4.179e-8` at N=1; no energy injection at any N), confirming the
  four-separate-passes mitigation against a cross-backend race.
- **Device-tier guidance: the practical particle budget depends on hardware tier, and rankings REVERSE
  with N.** Apple hardware is latency-strong and wins below the knee — the iPhone beats a desktop
  RTX 2070 by 2.0× at N=1 and 1.6× at N=1,000 — then loses above it (0.8× at N≥10,000). At
  `MAX_PARTICLES` = 60,000: M4 10.3 ms/frame (~97 fps physics ceiling), A17 Pro 16.0 ms (~62 fps, with
  nothing left for rendering). Budget roughly **30,000 grains on an A17-class phone** vs 60,000 on an
  M4. Quote a device tier AND an N with any performance claim; a single benchmark point ranks these
  devices wrong in one direction or the other.
- **NEW `GpuProbe` (wasm) + `/gpu-probe.html` — cross-device GPU verification** — a compute-only probe
  that runs the real `particle_step.wgsl` through the real `GpuParticles` on whatever device opens the
  page (iPad / phone / desktop), reporting which adapter ran, per-frame cost across N = 1…60,000, and
  whether total energy stays bounded. **Adds a read-only wasm-bindgen surface**
  (`GpuProbe::create` / `gpu_adapter_json` / `start_run` / `poll` / `result_json`); no existing engine
  behaviour or API changes. Note for anyone reading GPU results in a browser: wgpu's `AdapterInfo` is
  empty under `BROWSER_WEBGPU`, so adapter identity must come from `navigator.gpu`'s `GPUAdapterInfo`
  — and WebGPU offers no adapter enumeration, so the GPU cannot be chosen there, only recorded.
- **FIX: `scripts/dev-lan.sh`** — the readiness probe grepped for a string absent from `web/`, so the
  script always failed after a healthy start and never reused a running server. Its rebuild check also
  ignored `shaders/**.wgsl`, so editing a shader served a **stale** wasm while reporting it up to date.
- **`tools/gpu-verify` selects its GPU explicitly** — on a host with more than one discrete GPU the old
  `PowerPreference::HighPerformance` request silently picked whichever enumerated first, so runs could
  verify against an unintended card. Set `GPU_VERIFY_ADAPTER` (substring of the adapter name) to choose;
  with several GPUs and no value set the harness now refuses to run rather than guess. The selected
  adapter and driver version are printed on every run.
- **Worlds-as-data #2 — Space + Two Moons are now DATA scenes (docs/43)** — the world schema gained a
  `type:"system"` variant with a `bodies[]` array (orbital initial conditions: mass/radius/pos/vel/spin/profile)
  and an orbit camera (`yaw/pitch/zoom/focus`). New `OrbitDemo::load_world(json)` seeds the N-body scene from the
  file instead of hardcoded constants. The Space (one-moon) and Two Moons deorbit scenes now load
  `web/public/worlds/{one-moon,two-moons}/world.json`; the deorbit stays a user control (brake/drop), the crash
  emerges from physics. `World.planet` is now optional (a system world has no single planet). Birth of the Moon
  is unchanged for now.
- **FIX: Terra "growing black void" on descent** — the globe was back-face culled, so the fly camera looking down
  from just above the surface culled the near (front-facing) triangles → a black void at nadir that grew on
  descent (~250 km). The globe/cap now draw without culling (convex → depth occludes correctly), and the camera's
  near/far were tightened so the far hemisphere stays cleanly depth-occluded.
- **Terra data-driven controls + HUD (docs/43 Phase 6)** — key bindings now come from the world file
  (`controls.keys`: code → action), not code; `web/terra.ts` builds the input handler from it (WASD move + R/F
  climb/descend for Earth), and the HUD shows `world · altitude · lat/lon · biome · fps` with a controls hint
  derived from the bindings. New `Terra::ground_biome()` readback. Completes the docs/43 terrain rework
  (Phases 1–6): a navigable, data-defined Earth flown from orbit to the ground.
- **Terra ground LOD — the fine ground cap (docs/43 Phase 5)** — new `terra/ground_cap.rs`: a high-res patch
  rebuilt under the camera each frame (camera-relative f64→f32 for ground-scale precision), sampling real
  elevation + biome and curving to a true horizon, alpha cross-faded over the coarse globe as you descend (fully
  in below 15 km). Relief exaggeration is now one **declared dial** (`surface.relief_exaggeration`, default 1.0 =
  true scale) shared by the globe, cap, and camera floor — Earth set to real-ratio, retiring the ×30 hack so you
  can fly to a real ground-level horizon (no more burying). Orbital Earth is now photorealistically smooth.
- **Terra fly camera — continuous orbit ⇄ ground (docs/43 Phase 4)** — new `terra/fly_camera.rs`: one
  altitude-blended camera (drag orbits high up, free-looks near the ground; smoothstep transition) with a new
  `Terra` API (`set_fly` · `move_tangent` WASD · `zoom_alt` wheel · `drag_look` · `altitude_m/latitude/longitude`
  readbacks), seeded from the world file's `camera{}`. The view·projection is built in f64 for ground-scale
  precision. The camera is **physics-floored on the terrain** (height above the local terrain envelope, forced
  upward as terrain rises) so it never passes through solid ground. `web/terra.ts` drives it with a lat/lon/alt
  HUD. (Fine ground-level detail is Phase 5.)
- **Terra scene = a data-defined Earth globe (worlds-as-data, docs/43)** — a new `Terra` wasm scene renders Earth
  from a `world.json` + baked rasters (Natural Earth land mask · ETOPO elevation+bathymetry · derived land-cover
  biomes). Phase 3 adds `terra/globe_mesh.rs` (`build_globe`) + `shaders/globe.wgsl` + `Terra::build_surface_mesh`:
  a smooth **displaced cube-sphere globe** (land lifted by real elevation and biome-coloured; ocean flat at sea
  level with the water material) with relief-shaded normals and a blue atmospheric limb — the grain shell becomes
  the fallback. New host `web/terra.ts` / `web/terra.html`; nav label "Earth". Fly camera + ground LOD next.
- **Birth-of-the-Moon scene = the GPU impact + a "pretty render" layer, DEPLOYED** (`gpu_sph.rs`, `lib.rs`,
  `sph_render.wgsl`, `docs/42`) — the browser birth scene now runs the GPU SPH deformable-Earth impact by default
  (the old CPU-Aggregate impact retired) with a **Pretty ⇄ Physics slider** cross-fading a faithful render (textured
  Earth sphere · magma impact crater · ejecta plume · shocked-vapor atmosphere · accreting moonlet spheres) against
  the raw particle field. Browser physics brought to parity — **LOD seeding** (`HydroBody::new_lod`) + a **scheduled
  shock-dt** take the impact from a 0%-Earth hit-and-run to a ~27%-Earth disk with an accreting moonlet. Earth/Luna
  frame buttons use 👁 (eyes). The per-frame GPU load is now **adaptive** (frame-budget-controlled substeps) so
  the sim can't freeze the tab/OS, and a **zoom slider** gives reliable zoom when wheel events drop under load.
  Live at integrity.bothead.net.
- **Giant-impact disk Earth-fraction converged by ensemble** (`tools/impact-run`, `docs/40`→`docs/41` #3) — the
  offline GPU impact tool gained variable-resolution ("LOD") seeding, an order-independent disk measurement
  (sort+Kahan, bit-reproducible), a K-run perturbed-IC ensemble (mean±stdev), and a physical-time epoch stop.
  Result: the disk Earth-fraction is a **minority ~32%±3% (N≥2400, ~8 h epoch), not 58%**, and the disk
  **re-accretes** (fraction is epoch-dependent); a bound Moon-mass clump accretes in 8/8 runs. Enabling fix:
  **AV-free relaxation** (the docs/35 setting the standalone tool lacked). **Spin IOU closed:** a pre-impact
  proto-Earth spin (`impact-run spin`/`spineq`) makes the disk **rotationally sustained** and recovers **~58%
  Earth** — the canonical value the non-spinning impact never reached; verified not a startup artifact against a
  rotating-frame oblate equilibrium (`cs_relax` gained a relax-only `omega` centrifugal term, 0 for existing
  callers). Plus a browser shock-dt fix (the fixed-dt path under-resolved the shock → Theia hit-and-run).
  Nothing deployed.
- **GPU impact read-back + live disk stats** (`gpu_sph.rs`, `docs/35` — the GPU-path migration) — `GpuSph`
  gained two-phase async GPU→CPU read-back, and the browser birth scene now shows the live orbiting-disk
  provenance (mass, Earth %, remnant radius, largest self-bound clump) from the read-back particle field. The
  first increment of unifying the scenes onto the one GPU SPH path (retiring the CPU `Aggregate`).
- **EOS abstraction — one pressure law across air and rock** (`eos.rs`, `docs/33` stage 5) — a new `Eos` enum
  (`Tillotson` | `IdealGas`) with `pressure`/`sound_speed_sq`, so the shared SPH machinery is parameterized by
  the equation of state instead of hardcoding it. `hydrostatic::HydroBody` now carries `Vec<Eos>` (was
  `Vec<Tillotson>`) — EOS-agnostic, the seam to fold the duplicated `AirField`/vapor SPH loops onto one code
  path. Byte-identical to the old Tillotson path (verified: differentiated planet settles to the same central
  pressure; new ideal-gas dispatch test).
- **GPU SPH-EOS-gravity kernel, verified** (`shaders/sph_step.wgsl` + `tools/sph-verify`, `docs/33` stage 4a)
  — the space-band self-gravitating condensed-matter force step (SPH density + Tillotson pressure + Monaghan
  artificial viscosity + direct self-gravity + du/dt) ported to WGSL compute, for the giant impact at N~10⁵.
  Verified headless on the RTX 2070 (native Vulkan wgpu) against an independent f64 CPU computation of the
  same equations to f32 precision (RMS rel error 1.9e-6). Stage 4b adds a **spatial-hash neighbour grid** for
  the short-range SPH (O(N) not O(N²)), also verified exact — with a cell-membership guard that defeats the
  hash-collision double-counting. Stage 4c.1 adds the **KDK leapfrog integration loop** (`cs_kick_drift` +
  `cs_kick`, energy-conserving, matching the CPU `HydroBody::step`), verified over 50 fixed-dt steps against
  an f64 CPU reference (final-state RMS pos 3.1e-4 / vel 5.7e-4 / u 5.1e-4 — tracking, not diverging). Stage
  4c.2 adds `tools/impact-run` (GPU relaxation `cs_relax` + adaptive-dt KDK impact + provenance) and runs the
  deformable-Earth giant impact at N up to 35 000 on the RTX 2070 (minutes, vs the CPU's ~2100-particle cap):
  energy conserved to 0.3–0.5 % over ~10 h of aftermath, disk mass (~0.13–0.19 M☾), remnant radius, and
  escape speed robust across runs. The disk's Earth-derived *fraction* (28–50 % in samples, vs the CPU's
  58 %) has large run-to-run scatter — two identical N=35000 runs gave 50 % and 29 % (GPU-non-determinism ×
  chaotic amplification) — so it reproduces the deformable-Earth mechanism (Earth material orbits, docs/31)
  but the precise fraction remains an IOU pending an ensemble average + deterministic reduction + higher N.
  Stage 4c.3 adds the
  **accretion / growth operator** (`accretion.rs`): friends-of-friends bound-clump detection gated on genuine
  self-boundedness AND the remnant's Roche limit, promoting each qualifying clump to one body at its COM —
  conserving mass, momentum, and centre of mass exactly (TDD-verified to <1e-12), the growth law a round Moon
  needs. Stage 4c.4 completes stage 4c: the deformable-Earth giant impact now **runs live in the browser**
  (`gpu_sph.rs` hosts `sph_step.wgsl` on the space-band WebGPU device; `sph_render.wgsl` draws the particle
  field instanced; `OrbitDemo::start_gpu_impact()` / a "GPU Impact" button triggers it) — rig-watch verified
  on the RTX 2070: two differentiated bodies collide into a remnant + a two-provenance debris disk, stable at
  interactive frame rates.
- **Deformable-Earth giant impact — the isotopic crisis, re-measured** (`hydrostatic.rs`, `docs/33` stage
  3) — a full thermodynamic SPH giant impact between two real EOS particle bodies: the SPH internal-energy
  equation + Monaghan artificial viscosity (shock capture) + an energy-conserving KDK leapfrog with an
  adaptive Courant timestep (verified: a relaxed head-on collision conserves total energy to ~3% and
  shock-heats, IE up 4.9×). Then the payoff: a differentiated Theia into a **deformable differentiated
  proto-Earth** yields an orbiting disk that is **58% EARTH-derived** — versus the rigid-boundary ceiling of
  7–12% (docs/31). With Earth as real matter that sheds its own mantle, Earth material dominates the disk —
  the direction the isotopic crisis demands (docs/28 root-cause #1 dissolved). Sub-Earth scale + coarse N:
  the direction, not a converged number (the value awaits the GPU N, stage 4).
- **Self-gravitating EOS body — a particle planet in hydrostatic equilibrium** (`hydrostatic.rs`, `docs/33`
  stage 2) — composes the shared kernels (`eos::Tillotson` + the SPH kernel + `bhtree` self-gravity) into a
  cloud of particles that holds itself up under its own gravity via EOS pressure, instead of the rigid
  analytic boundary the impact scene uses (docs/28 #1). **Single-material (2a):** a 1500 km basalt body
  settles with pointwise hydrostatic balance dP/dr=−ρg (rel 0.00–0.01). **Differentiated (2b):** an
  Earth-mass iron-core + basalt-mantle body (equal-mass particles + adaptive smoothing length, the Genda
  2012 method) COMPRESSES (RMS 5709→3973 km, no puff-up), stays stratified (core ρ 15,591 vs mantle 5534
  kg/m³), holds balance (rel 6%), and reaches a central pressure of 572 GPa — the order of Earth's real 364
  GPa. Iron EOS uses the verified Wissing & Hobbs 2020 compressed-branch refit. The prerequisite for a
  deformable Earth; folds into `Aggregate` at unification.
- **Tillotson condensed-matter EOS** (`eos.rs`, `docs/33` stage 1) — `P(ρ, u)` across cold / shock-
  compressed / decompressed / vapor states in one closure (Tillotson 1962; Melosh 1989; Benz et al. 1989),
  with cited parameters for granite, basalt, peridotite (dunite/olivine), and iron. `pressure`,
  `sound_speed_sq`, `for_material`. The missing "matter under its own pressure" law — solids previously
  resisted compression only via a linear-elastic contact penalty and planet densities were declared
  constants. Verified: cold reference P≈0, cold compression yields the real bulk modulus A, monotonic
  stiffening to GPa scale, hot expansion → the ideal-gas limit, continuity across vaporization, km/s sound
  speed. Not yet wired into a scene (stage 2 builds the self-gravitating planet on it).
- **Architecture map, CLAUDE.md, and realignment plan** (`docs/32`, `docs/33`, `CLAUDE.md`) — a durable
  orientation for future sessions (module-by-module with `file:line` anchors; the shared-laws-vs-forked-
  solvers map; the EOS inventory confirming NO condensed-matter EOS exists) plus a staged plan to realign
  the engine to its principles: one particle/material module, one Tillotson EOS spanning solid→liquid→vapor,
  and energy-tiered calculations (T0 bulk → T3 full-EOS-shock, selected by energy density). No code change.
- **Proto-Earth spin + the isotopic crisis** (`docs/31`) — the excavated Earth cap is surface mantle that
  co-rotated before the impact, so `build_impact_debris_scaled` now takes an `earth_omega` and gives each
  target grain its co-rotating velocity `ω × (pos − centre)` before the ploughing loft (`ω = 0` is
  byte-identical to before); the scene converts `spin_l → ω = L/I` and passes it, default zero (unknown
  IC, flagged — no on-screen change). MEASURED (`a_fast_spinning_protoearth_makes_the_disk_earth_derived`):
  a fast-spinning proto-Earth (2.3 h day, Ćuk & Stewart 2012) does NOT Earth-enrich the disk — it grows the
  whole bound disk (1.40 → 2.59 M☾) but the Earth fraction falls (12 % → 7 %), because Earth is a rigid
  boundary (docs/28 #1) and only the small excavated cap can reach the disk. The honest resolution needs
  Earth-as-matter or vapor-phase mixing, not target spin. Physics deciding against the hypothesis, recorded.
- **Accelerated particle compute module** (`docs/30`) — a reusable O(N log N) substrate for ANY particle
  system (weather, clouds, fluids, not just impact), each stage proven against its exact/θ-bounded
  reference so speed never changes the answer. **Neighbour grid** (`neighbors.rs`): O(N) short-range pair
  finding, wired into the contact + SPH loops (`grid_finds_exactly_the_brute_force_pairs`,
  `contact_grid_matches_brute_force`). **Barnes–Hut self-gravity** (`bhtree.rs`): octree COM grouping at
  θ=0.5 turns O(N²) gravity into O(N log N), same softening as the direct sum
  (`barnes_hut_matches_brute_force_within_theta_bound` — RMS < 1%, θ→0 exact). **Block timesteps**
  (`aggregate.rs`): per-particle timestep criterion + hierarchical block-KDK `step_block` — the quiescent
  disk coasts while the shocked/vapor core sub-steps, with a subset-force pass
  (`accelerations_masked` + `BarnesHut::accelerations_active`) recomputing gravity only for the bodies
  kicked this sub-step, and full thermo (extracted to `apply_thermo`) run each sub-step. **5.5× faster**
  on an aftermath-shape cloud (`step_block_speedup_bench`) while reproducing the coupled impact disk
  (`birth_impact_with_step_block_reproduces_the_disk` — global 0.772 vs block 0.788 M☾). Wired into the
  space scene and running at high N (512 debris + 1024 cap, cap-mass summed from real per-grain masses).
- **Agent-watches-the-scene tooling** — `rig/birth_shot.mjs` screenshots birth.html under headless
  Chromium at timed marks so the agent can see the disk form; a "📷 Share view" button on the space band
  POSTs the live canvas to a receiver. (Public-site receiver `tools/shot-server.mjs` staged, not installed.)
- **Vapor SPH pressure field + latent-heat reservoir** (`docs/26`/`27`, `docs/28` item 5) — impact vapor
  now expands and self-cools as a real gas: cubic-spline SPH density, `P=ρ·R_s·T`, a symmetric
  momentum-conserving pressure force, and a PdV energy equation (expansion does work → the gas cools).
  Pressure reads the *thermal* temperature `T − L_v/c` so the vaporization latent heat is not
  double-counted as pressure. Replaces the vapor "overlap hack" (a docs/23 fudge). Test:
  `vapor_sph_expands_and_cools_conserving_energy` (80k → 18.5k K, energy conserved).
- **Momentum-conserving loft in the shared particle physics** (`granular::plough_loft`, `docs/28` step 3)
  — when a fast body ploughs slower target matter, the along-track momentum is shared inelastically toward
  the impactor↔cap centre-of-mass velocity (the physical maximum drag, no dial) and Σ(m·v) is exactly
  conserved. This is what makes the Moon **Earth-derived** — target material now lofts into the bound disk
  (Earth 0.083 M☾ aloft, up from a dead 0.000 at every resolution) once the cap mass is physical. One law
  for every band (space wired; terrain a flagged follow-up). Tests:
  `plough_loft_conserves_momentum_and_lofts_the_lighter_target`, and the disk provenance guardrails.
- **Materials-honest per-grain contact** (`docs/23`) — the aggregate contact law reads each grain's
  material (`Contact::mix` per pair: radius arithmetic-mean, stiffness harmonic-mean, damping/friction
  geometric-mean, cohesion min), so iron collides as iron and peridotite as peridotite instead of every
  grain being bulk basalt. Fixes the over-massed excavation cap — grain mass is now real `ρ·V` at the
  local density (`furrow_target_grains`), ≈0.31× the impactor rather than a bookkeeping 2×. Tests:
  `contact_mix_is_idempotent_and_bounded`, `mixed_material_contact_conserves_momentum`.
- **Bodies as particle aggregates** (`docs/21`) — the gravitational skeleton for making celestial
  destruction a *simulation, not a mock*. `aggregate.rs`: a body is a cloud of particles bound by
  softened N-body self-gravity; `binding_energy`, `kinetic_energy_com`, `rms_radius`, `com`. A cold
  cloud holds together (emergent cohesion/roundness) and an energy kick above its binding energy
  disrupts it (emergent shatter). Material/thermal per particle, impact coupling, and rendering staged.
  Tests: `aggregate::a_self_gravitating_cloud_holds_together`, `energy_above_binding_disrupts_it`.
- **Phase classes integrated into `matter::impact`** (`docs/20`) — each ejecta is classified via
  `damage::classify` (Fractured / Melted / Vaporized) from the thermodynamic thresholds; vaporized
  matter expands away fast (gas/plasma). Crater extent unchanged (LOD bridge intact). Test:
  `matter::a_colossal_impact_vaporizes_the_core`.
- **Moon-speed HUD readout** (km/s relative to Earth) in the space band — confirms there's no drag /
  terminal velocity in vacuum (a true Drop climbs to ~11 km/s at impact; a partial brake slows at
  apogee by Kepler's 2nd law).
- **Glowing molten ejecta + a Meteor control** (`docs/20`) — the first visual of impact damage. Impact
  ejecta carry `temp_k`; heat peaks at the contact and falls to cold at the crater rim (centre melts,
  rim is cold rubble). `emission::incandescence` maps temperature → a black-body glow (red→white) that
  the particle shader *adds*, so molten debris self-illuminates even on the dark side. Fire it with the
  `☄`/`m` **Meteor** button in the terrain slice (`Engine::meteor`). Tests:
  `emission::cold_matter_does_not_glow_and_hotter_glows_brighter_and_whiter`,
  `matter::a_big_impact_melts_the_centre_and_leaves_the_rim_cold`. (Crater extent is physical; ejecta
  temperature is a first visual model, not yet energy-conserved — the celestial→voxel fly-in stays staged.)
- **Impact thermodynamics — fracture/melt/vaporize** (`docs/20`). One data-driven response: an impact
  deposits energy density (J/m³), and `damage::classify` compares it to a material's own thresholds —
  fracture strength → melt energy `ρ(cΔT+L_f)` → vaporization energy — returning
  `Intact/Fractured/Melted/Vaporized`. Because the density falls with distance, one event yields all
  four at different radii (a scale-of-detail test too). Added optional `Material.thermal` (specific
  heat, melt/boil points, latent heats) with cited data for basalt, granite, iron, water; materials
  without it can only fracture. Test: `damage::impact_fractures_then_melts_then_vaporizes_by_energy_density`.
  Integration into the impact operator and the visual (incandescent melt, vapor plume, fly-in crater)
  are staged.
- **Two-moon stress-test scene** (`/twomoons.html`). Two moons on the same orbit, opposite sides of the
  Earth, de-orbited both at once. `OrbitDemo` generalized from one moon to N (per-moon uniforms,
  lighting, framing; Earth-vs-each-moon collision with both impact energies summed); `brake_moon` /
  `drop_moon` act on all moons; focus cycles Earth → Moon A → Moon B. Added to the scene picker; the
  moon count comes from `<body data-moons>` so both space pages share one script.
- **LOD-adaptive damage — the crater bridge** (`docs/19`). A damage event is the same event at every
  scale: the coarse **summary** (`damage::crater_volume` = `E/σ`) and the fine **voxel crater**
  (`matter::impact`) use the same `σ·V` accounting and agree — proven by
  `matter::voxel_crater_matches_the_coarse_damage_summary`. Honest regimes: strength crater, gravity
  (flagged), and **disruption** past a body's binding energy. The Moon impact (~4.5e30 J) is ~36× the
  Moon's binding energy (Moon shatters) but ~2% of Earth's (Earth survives → planet-scale crater); the
  space-band HUD now reports this. The *visual* zoom-in to materialise the crater is designed and
  staged (`docs/19`).
- **Unified deformation & damage — design + first slice** (`docs/18`). One operator for a bullet, a
  pebble in a pond, and a Moon-into-Earth impact: response governed by material data (material
  invariance) at the resolution the observer's frame can perceive (scale/frame invariance). Concrete
  steps: (1) parse material `phase` and fix the liquid fudge — water's `fracture_strength` no longer
  falls back to an unbreakable `1e12` (it was stronger than granite!); a fluid now yields at ~0. (2)
  `MatterSim::impact(site, direction, energy)` — the generalized energy-driven impact: spends the
  impact energy fracturing voxels nearest-first (σ·V each), so bigger energy → bigger crater, stronger
  material → smaller crater, a liquid splashes; a bullet and the Moon are the same call. Tests:
  `materials::a_liquid_yields_where_a_solid_resists`, `matter::impact_is_material_and_scale_invariant`.
- **Orbital-decay control + real collision** in the space band (`docs/17`). `Brake Moon ½×` halves the
  Moon's velocity relative to Earth (a single halving still misses — real orbital mechanics), `Drop
  Moon` cancels it for a radial plunge, `Reset` restores. `orbit::resolve_contact` gives the bodies
  **surface collision** (they stop when their surfaces meet instead of tunnelling through as point
  masses); `orbit::perigee` drives a live closest-approach readout that reddens before a crash. The
  impact's energy is measured and reported (`orbit::inelastic_dissipation` vs `binding_energy`): a
  dropped Moon releases ~4.5e30 J ≈ 36× the Moon's binding energy — the HUD says plainly both bodies
  would be destroyed (actual fragmentation is future, flagged not faked). Variable **time multiplier**
  now exposed in the HUD.
- **Live real-Sun lighting + selectable focus frame** in the space band (`docs/17`). The demo now
  simulates `[Sun, Earth, Moon]` with the Earth on its true heliocentric orbit; the shader lights each
  body from the Sun's *actual position* (per-body, so phases are geometric), and the Sun — far
  off-frame at this zoom — is the light source, not a drawn disk. A focus toggle (`cycle_focus`) makes
  the viewport a physical frame of reference, re-centring on Earth or the Moon.
- **Scene picker** (`web/src/scene-nav.ts`) — a small nav injected on both pages to switch between the
  terrain slice and the space band; the scene list lives in one place.

### Changed
- **Honest space-band appearance** (`docs/17`) — removed the hardcoded ocean-blue/grey body tints
  (fudge) in favour of colour derived from a **real material composition**, aggregated by the new
  `materials::aggregate_albedo` operator (Earth = ocean water + continental rock + polar ice; Moon =
  basalt). The space shader now computes **illumination × reflectance** + Reinhard tone-map, so a
  physically dark body (basalt albedo ~0.05) reads correctly bright under a bright sun, instead of
  being faked bright. Deliberately no atmospheric "blue-marble" blue (unmodelled → not faked).

### Added
- `materials::aggregate_albedo` — the scale-relative summary operator (fraction-weighted mean albedo of
  a composition); the same reduction for any object at any zoom. Tested.
- `orbit::sun_earth_moon_system_is_bound` — a real Sun (proper mass/distance) plus the Earth's
  **appropriate heliocentric velocity**, verifying the Moon stays bound to the Earth while the Earth
  orbits the Sun (3-body, energy-conserving).
- Operating principle / candidate engine name: **"Integrity"** — every rendered value traces to
  something real or is openly flagged as a placeholder (`docs/17`).

### Changed (prior)
- **Unified awake-set dynamics** (`docs/16`) — the probe and the debris are now one system: every
  not-at-rest body feels the same gravity field and resolves contacts against the world *and each
  other*. Debris↔body impulses are momentum-conserving (a thrown clod shoves the probe; the probe
  scatters debris), settling debris never deposits inside a body (piles on it, matter conserved), and
  sleep/wake is structural (a body wakes the instant its support is removed or it's touched). Fixes the
  probe appearing to "rest on nothing" and not truly reacting to debris. New native tests cover
  momentum transfer, no-deposit-inside-body, and wake-on-unsupport.

### Notes
- **Physical-honesty debt flagged:** no atmosphere is modelled, so the per-step `DRAG` in `matter.rs`
  is a numerical stabilizer, not real air drag (documented as debt in `docs/16`).
- **Compute-budget policy** (`docs/16`): favour larger/more massive objects; massive bodies are
  budget-exempt, and debris coarsening will merge into mass-carrying clumps (conserving mass on spawn
  *and* settle) rather than dropping particles — deferred to the `docs/08` clumping work.

### Added
- **Representation invariant** (`docs/15`) — written down as canonical: *a voxel is a sampling cell,
  never a unit of matter.* The cubic grid is a coordinate lattice we sample continuous fields on (like
  pixels), not an ontology of blocks; all physical state lives on matter with continuous coordinates,
  and the grid dissolves into particles the moment physics touches it. Roundness (planets, spheres) is
  emergent from isotropic gravity, exactly as in nature — so building on a cubic lattice is not a
  foundational mistake. Also captures the "feels right in VR" corollary: behaviour is a natural
  property of the world and the object (leave it unsupported, it falls), never per-object fakery.
- **Grid-isotropy regression suite** (`crates/engine/src/isotropy.rs`) enforcing that invariant:
  gravity on a symmetric ball is radial and equal-magnitude in every direction (axes + diagonals), and
  `dig` carves a true Euclidean sphere (right volume, equal reach per axis, no lateral ejection bias).
  Each guard was verified non-vacuous by confirming it goes red under a deliberately anisotropic mutant.

- **GPU Barnes–Hut solver, built + verified; measured NOT worth wiring in-browser** (`tools/gpu-bh-verify` +
  `shaders/bh_gravity.wgsl`, `docs/36`→`docs/37`) — the full LBVH self-gravity pipeline (adaptive bbox → Morton
  → interim CPU sort → Karras tree → atomic-free bottom-up COM → robust-MAC θ-traversal) as verified WGSL
  compute kernels. Correctness proven stage-by-stage against CPU references (bbox exact, Morton bit-exact, tree
  structural, COM <1e-6, θ=0.5 RMS 0.70 %, θ→0 recovers the exact direct sum). **Finding:** on the RTX 2070 GPU
  direct-sum beats Barnes–Hut until **N≈128k** (BH is 0.6–0.9× at N≤32k); asymptotics are correct (direct
  O(N²), BH O(N log N)) but the crossover sits far above the browser (N≤20k) and offline (N≈35k) regimes, so BH
  would *reduce* in-browser fps. **Decision (2026-07-18): defer (option B)** — keep direct O(N²) gravity
  everywhere; do not wire BH or build the GPU radix sort. A per-pass frame breakdown (`impact-run bench`, new)
  quantified it: on the 2070 gravity is ~35–50 % of the frame across the browser range but SPH grid+pressure is
  the co-equal half (and the grid saturates past 64k), interactive ceiling ~12–15k, all far below the 128k BH
  crossover. Hardware caveat recorded: on unified-memory parts (M4/A18/Snapdragon) a CPU-`bhtree`+GPU-SPH
  realtime hybrid needs zero new GPU code and the crossover likely drops. No engine physics changed; the
  verified BH crate is banked. Full write-up + revisit triggers + resume plan in `docs/37`.
## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-09

**Space band — you can now *watch* the Moon orbit.** The first rung of the scale-relative ladder
(`docs/13`, Step A): a spectator view of the real Earth + Moon, positioned by the validated N-body
physics from `orbit.rs` (v0.8.0). Physics runs in real SI units (f64); metres map to display units
(Earth radius → 1) only for drawing. Separate page, so the terrain slice is untouched.

### Added
- `OrbitDemo` (wasm) + `shaders/space.wgsl` — two lit spheres (ocean-blue Earth, grey Moon) with a
  directional "sun" (so you see phases), driven by `orbit::verlet_step` each frame, time-scaled so a
  full ~27.3-day orbit plays in ~20 s. HUD shows live Earth–Moon separation (hovers near 384,400 km).
- `web/orbit.html` + `web/src/orbit.ts` — camera-only host (drag orbit, pinch/wheel zoom); Vite
  multi-page build now emits both the terrain slice and the space band.
- `docs/13-scale-relative-simulation.md` — the north-star architecture (observer-relative fidelity).
- `docs/14-validation-demonstrations.md` — catalogue mapping each physics test to what it proves and
  how it becomes a visible demonstration for the full build.

### Notes
- The physics is verified natively (`orbit::moon_orbits_earth`); the *visuals* are confirmed on-device
  (headless WebGPU can't render the pipeline here). Next: Step B — refine the planet surface into the
  voxel terrain as you zoom in.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-09

**Orbital-mechanics validation (N-body).** The gravity law is now validated against real celestial
motion, not just voxel self-gravity.

### Added
- `orbit.rs` — N-body point-mass gravity with a symplectic **velocity-Verlet** integrator, plus
  energy/angular-momentum helpers. Native test: the **real Earth + Moon** (masses, 384,400 km,
  ~1.022 km/s) produce a **bound orbit** — the Moon completes ≥1 revolution, its distance stays
  within 15% of the real value, and energy + angular momentum are conserved to <1%. "If the Moon
  orbits the planet, the simulator is good" — it does.

### Notes
- Foundation for a future planet-scale demo. The validation itself needs **no rendering** (a pure
  native test), which sidesteps the headless-WebGPU limitation entirely.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Probe clipped into crater walls — looked duplicated and rested at the wrong height.** The sphere
  only collided with the terrain column directly beneath it, so near a dig it embedded in the wall
  (visible through the thin smoothed surface as a "second ball"). Replaced with proper **sphere-vs-
  voxel collision**: it's pushed out of *any* solid voxel it overlaps (floor, walls, corners), with
  restitution + friction. Solid objects act solid now. Native tests: rests on a voxel floor without
  penetrating; doesn't clip into a wall.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 6 fixes** (from an iPad play-test).

### Fixed
- **Terrain was hollow / open on some sides.** Surface Nets had only one cell of boundary padding, so
  the outer walls sat at the grid edge where closing quads can't form → holes. Padded by two cells;
  new `surface_nets_mesh_is_closed` test verifies the mesh is **watertight** (0 boundary edges).
- **"Eroded cubes" / poor shading.** Feed Surface Nets a **smoothed** (box-blurred) occupancy field so
  the iso-surface rounds properly, and use its own **consistently-outward** normals (a binary field's
  gradient is blocky and my geometry-normal recompute could invert walls).
- **Long-press blast "grew" mounds.** Debris used a center-of-mass gravity approximation that pulls
  off-center matter inward, so it drifted to the middle and piled up. Debris now uses the **full**
  aggregated field (near-straight-down on the slab); the field is coarsened (block 8) to keep the
  per-particle queries cheap.

### Added
- `web/screenshot.mjs` — a headless-Chromium (Playwright) visual-check harness for verifying the
  WebGPU render. Needs GPU render-node access; without it, Chromium falls back to software (SwiftShader),
  which can't run the texture-array pipeline.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 6 — smooth surface meshing.** Terrain and craters render as smooth surfaces instead of
Minecraft-style cubes. The voxel grid stays the physics substrate; only the *visual* changes.

### Added
- `mesher::build_surface_nets` — Surface Nets (via the `fast-surface-nets` crate) over the voxel
  occupancy field, with **smooth normals recomputed from the geometry** (the binary field's own
  gradient is blocky) and oriented outward. Each vertex is tagged with the nearest solid voxel's
  material, so triplanar texturing (Phase 4) and specular shine still apply. Native-tested (valid,
  finite, and genuinely smooth — non-axis-aligned normals).
- The renderer uses it for the initial terrain and every dig re-mesh. The blocky `build` mesher is
  kept as a reference/fallback.

### Notes
- Sim/visual decoupling: physics (mass, gravity, fracture, collapse) is unchanged — the world is
  still "voxels all the way down"; the renderer just presents it smoothly.
- Binary field ⇒ mildly-rounded geometry + smooth shading. Further realism (a smoothed/SDF field for
  rounder geometry, normal maps, finer debris) is future work.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 5 — structural collapse.** Matter that a dig undercuts or isolates no longer floats: anything
not connected to the ground falls. Removes the Phase-3 "floating voxels" limitation.

### Added
- `world.find_unsupported()` — flood-fill from the anchored base (`y = 0`); returns every solid voxel
  not connected to it (6-connectivity). Handles overhangs, undercuts, and blasted-off chunks uniformly.
- `MatterSim::collapse()` — detaches unsupported voxels into falling particles (from rest); one pass
  suffices (the remainder is fully supported). Triggered after every dig.
- Native tests: intact terrain has zero unsupported voxels; an isolated voxel collapses, conserves
  matter, and re-settles into the grid.

### Notes
- Collapse is O(voxels) per edit (a user action, not per-frame). If a collapse would exceed the
  particle budget it caps (a few voxels may remain floating) — noted as a bound, not a silent drop.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 4 — emergent textures.** Completes the vertical-slice roadmap. Materials get a distinct look
generated *from their own physical properties* — no bundled image files, zero licensing exposure.

### Added
- `texture.rs` — procedural texture generator: high-res (512²) RGBA with a full mip chain, synthesized
  from `albedo` + `color_variance` + `metallic` (grain/mottle from tileable multi-octave noise,
  mineral flecks, metal sparkle specks). Seamless (wrapping lattice). Native tests: size + mip chain,
  mean color tracks albedo, materials differ, non-flat variation.
- World shader: **triplanar** sampling of a per-material procedural texture array (no UVs), plus a
  **specular highlight (shine)** driven by per-material `roughness`/`metallic` (metals get a tighter,
  tinted highlight). Material id per vertex; the probe renders as textured iron.
- `materials.rs` loads `roughness`/`metallic`/`color_variance`. HUD adds an **FPS** counter.
- `docs/12` — texture approach + verified CC0 sources (ambientCG/Poly Haven) for optional
  user-supplied real textures via the module system.

### Notes
- Mipmapping is the "client can scale it down" mechanism; `TEX_SIZE` is one constant to raise for
  more detail. The engine bundles **no images** — a material *module* may later drop in a CC0 photo.
- This closes the initial Phase 0–4 vertical slice: layered voxel matter · self-gravity · dig &
  fracture · emergent texture — all from the cited material database.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 3 — dig & material-driven fracture.** Click to dig; matter breaks apart according to each
material's own strength, falls under gravity, and settles back into the world.

### Added
- `matter.rs` — CPU matter solver: spherical dig via voxel raycast; a voxel detaches into a particle
  only if the tool's stress exceeds its material's `fracture_strength` (granite resists a tool that
  shreds soil/grass — no per-material special-casing, just the numbers). Debris falls under the
  Phase-2 field and, on rest, deposits back into the voxel grid (piling; matter-conserving). Native
  tests: soft-vs-hard selectivity, and matter conservation through dig + settle.
- `world.rs` — voxel raycast (Amanatides–Woo DDA) for picking, `set_voxel`, `solid_count`.
- `materials.rs` — loads `fracture_strength` (tensile strength, falling back to cohesion).
- Renderer — instanced debris cubes (`particles.wgsl`), terrain re-mesh on edit; HUD shows debris
  count. Controls: **click** to dig soil/grass, **shift-click** to blast rock.

### Notes
- This is the CPU-tested **foundation** for full continuum MLS-MPM, not the full method yet — it
  delivers dig/fracture/granular behavior emergent from material data. MLS-MPM (deformation gradient +
  constitutive stress, then a WGSL port) is the planned evolution (`docs/06`/`08`).
- Micro-gravity again: ejection is capped below the world's ~7 cm/s escape velocity so debris stays
  bound and re-settles (correct physics, viewed via the time-scale).
- Digging a mid-column hole can leave voxels above "floating" — structural collapse is future work.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 2 — self-gravity & the falling probe.** Density stops being decorative and starts doing
physics: the world's summed voxel mass produces a real Newtonian gravitational field, and a sphere
falls under it (`F = ma`) and rests on the surface.

### Added
- `gravity.rs` — aggregate voxel-mass gravity field (voxels lumped into blocks; direct-sum
  `g(p) = ΣG·mᵢ·(cᵢ−p)/|cᵢ−p|³`, f64 accumulation). Native tests: point-mass `G·M/r²`, far-field,
  mass conservation.
- `body.rs` — rigid sphere integrated with semi-implicit Euler under the field, with ground contact,
  restitution/friction, and a scale-relative rest threshold (works from Earth-g to micro-g). Native
  tests: free-fall kinematics, fall-and-rest.
- Renderer draws the probe (a second mesh with a per-object model matrix); live HUD shows world mass,
  local gravity, probe altitude/speed, rest state, and time-scale. Controls: `Space`/`R` re-drop,
  `[`/`]` time-scale.
- End-to-end native test: the probe falls toward the generated world and rests on it.

### Notes
- Real `G` is used, so the ~96 m test world has asteroid-scale micro-g (~1e-5 m/s²) — correct
  physics. A **time-scale** (default 250×) fast-forwards the sim for viewing; it is time-lapse, not
  amplified gravity.
- The probe is hand-integrated (one body); Rapier is deferred until many bodies / arbitrary contacts
  justify it. The rendered sphere is enlarged for visibility (free-fall is size/mass-independent).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 1 — layered voxel world.** The cited material data becomes a rendered, orbitable world.

### Added
- `data/materials.json` — 19 cited materials (density, moduli, strengths, hardness, albedo, …) as
  the physical single source of truth (`docs/04`).
- Engine sim modules (natively unit-tested): `materials` (loads the database), `world` (chunked
  voxel store + layered rock/dirt/grass generator with a value-noise heightfield, using real
  densities), `mesher` (face-culling mesh, per-material albedo colors).
- Real 3D renderer: depth buffer, perspective orbit camera, directional + hemispheric lighting;
  `Engine.set_orbit(yaw, pitch, zoom)`. Host adds drag-to-orbit / scroll-to-zoom.
- `cargo test` suite (material load, layer ordering, mesh validity) — TDD is canonical; wgpu/wasm
  code is gated to the wasm target so the sim logic tests natively.
- Design docs `05`–`10`: Postgres→JSON data pipeline, material modules, taxonomy/finishes/object
  composition, adaptive clumping/LOD, agentic authoring + interaction, and robustness principles.
- CI: fmt + clippy + native tests + wasm build on every push.

### Notes
- Face-culling (blocky) mesher for now; smooth surface-nets meshing is a planned upgrade.
- Density is stored per material but not yet physically active — it drives self-gravity in Phase 2.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-08

First milestone: **Phase 0 — scaffold & first pixel.** The full Rust → WASM → `wgpu` → canvas
pipeline is live, driven by a thin Vite/TypeScript host.

### Added
- Cargo workspace with the `engine` crate (`cdylib` + `rlib`) compiled to WASM via `wasm-pack`.
- `Engine` WASM API: `Engine.create(canvas)`, `render()`, `resize(w, h)` — a `wgpu` WebGPU
  device that clears the canvas with a pulsing color each frame.
- Vite + TypeScript host (`web/`) that loads the WASM, sizes the canvas, and pumps
  `requestAnimationFrame`, with a graceful "WebGPU unavailable" message.
- Project meta: MIT license, `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `JOURNAL`, this changelog, and two
  research reports under `docs/` surveying prior art and reusable OSS building blocks.

### Notes
- Pinned to `wgpu` 24.0.5. WebGPU-only backend to keep the WASM small.
- **Public API is unstable** while we're pre-1.0 (see versioning policy).
