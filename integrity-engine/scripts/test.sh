# Run the greenfield engine test suite from a fixed entrypoint, so it can be permission-allow-listed
# (`bash integrity-engine/scripts/test.sh`) without triggering a bash-expansion prompt every run.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/test.sh                # FULL suite — all 136 tests (the deploy gate)
#   bash scripts/test.sh --fast         # fast inner loop — skips the 5 long integration tests
#   bash scripts/test.sh furrow         # only tests matching a filter (passed straight through)
#   bash scripts/test.sh --fast furrow  # both: fast group intersected with a filter
#
# --fast skips ONLY the five long-running numerical-integration tests (each >1s; together they are
# essentially the entire ~24s wall-time). It never weakens or drops any assertion — it is a subset
# for the "edit → test → repeat" loop. ALWAYS run the full suite (no --fast) before deploying.
# The five excluded: the three giant-impact disk-lofting tests (an_oblique_theia / the_birth_scene /
# provenance), the SPH hydrostatic-balance test (sph_air_field), and the dropped-moon impact test
# (the SPH-side pin in gpu_sph, ~9s; it replaced the CPU Aggregate one when that path retired).
#
# Prefers cargo-nextest when installed (parallel execution + per-test timing); falls back to
# `cargo test` otherwise. nextest does not run doctests; this crate currently has none, so there is
# no separate --doc step. Tests build at opt-level = 3 (see [profile.test] in the workspace
# Cargo.toml) — the suite is runtime-bound, so that is a ~8x wall-time win.
#
# Prints just the result/error lines; the full output is saved to /tmp/gf-test.log.

# The five long-running integration tests. Kept in one place, in both the nextest filterset syntax
# and the libtest --skip form, so --fast means the same thing on either runner.
