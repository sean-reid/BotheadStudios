//! **Refinement: the celestial field initializes the local patch, conserved** (docs/59).
//!
//! The upward rung of resolution-by-necessity for the SPH field: when the zoom commits, the coarse
//! celestial particles inside the committed region split ONCE into fine children that carry exactly
//! the coarse field's mass, momentum, angular momentum, kinetic and internal energy, then relax
//! against the coarse field's own interpolated density before the event proceeds. This is the
//! conserved hand-down of docs/59 (order-of-work item 3), the mirror of `crate::recohere`'s
//! downward rung: matter changes representation, never amount (Law IV).
//!
//! **UNWIRED BY DESIGN (flagged IOU, Law V).** This module has no production consumer yet. The
//! camera-driven materialization trigger and the scene wiring belong to the M4 zoom
//! materialization milestone (docs/59 order-of-work item 2 and its open questions), which owns
//! where the entry point lives; the docs/46 ledger carries the row. Landing the rung unwired is
//! deliberate: the trigger's home depends on collision routing decisions (docs/58 item 7) that are
//! not this module's to make.
//!
//! # The split (one-shot, conserving by construction)
//!
//! Each parent splits on the icosahedron stencil with a mandatory retained center child, 13
//! children in all (Vacondio et al. 2016, CMAME 300:442; error analysis per Feldman and Bonet
//! 2007, IJNME 72:295). Children inherit the parent's velocity and specific internal energy;
//! child masses sum exactly to the parent's (the center child absorbs the division remainder in
//! f64 before the f32 cast). Because the 12 vertex directions sum to zero and vertex children
//! share one mass, the children's barycenter IS the parent position, so mass, momentum, angular
//! momentum, kinetic and internal energy are conserved exactly up to f32 rounding. The one-shot
//! (not continuously adaptive) shape follows production impact practice: resolution is graded in
//! the initial conditions, not mid-run (Kegerreis et al. 2019, MNRAS 487:5029; Stickle et al.
//! 2022; Owen et al. 2022, Planet. Sci. J. 3).
//!
//! # The two stencil constants, re-derived for THIS kernel
//!
//! The literature values (separation 0.4 h, child smoothing 0.9 h) were derived for kernels in the
//! 2h-support convention; this engine's ONE cubic-spline kernel ([`crate::atmosphere::sph_w`])
//! carries its full support inside r < h with sigma = 8/(pi h^3), so the constants were re-derived
//! offline rather than copied (Law VII). Method: least squares of the integrated squared density
//! error between the parent's kernel and the 13-child stencil,
//! `E(lambda, alpha) = integral over R^3 of (rho_children - rho_parent)^2 dV`, with children of
//! equal mass m/13 at the 12 icosahedron vertices (circumradius `lambda * h`) plus the retained
//! center, child smoothing `alpha * h`. Quadrature on a 141^3 grid over [-1.4h, 1.4h]^3, verified
//! unchanged at 201^3; Nelder-Mead for the minimum.
//!
//! The UNCONSTRAINED problem is degenerate: E has its global minimum at lambda -> 0, alpha -> 1
//! (13 co-located children reproduce the parent exactly and refine nothing). The physical answer
//! is the interior stationary point, the smallest-error genuinely refining split:
//!
//! - `lambda = 0.3051` (separation / h), against 0.2 for the literature pair mapped into this
//!   kernel's support-radius convention;
//! - `alpha = 0.7915` (child h / parent h), against 0.9 in the literature;
//! - residual of the optimal stencil: relative L2 density error 0.70 percent, peak pointwise
//!   error 0.38 percent of the parent's central density. The literature pair evaluated on THIS
//!   kernel gives 4.9 percent relative L2, which is why the re-derivation was not optional.
//!
//! The stencil orientation is one fixed global icosahedron for every parent: deterministic and
//! reproducible; the relax pass owns removing any alignment artifact. Constants were derived in
//! the scatter (own-h) density convention the literature uses; the release criterion below is
//! measured in the engine's own symmetrized pairwise-h convention (`sph_step.wgsl` uses
//! h_ij = (h_i + h_j)/2), so the relax owns the difference between the two conventions too.
//!
//! # Relax, then release (frozen clock)
//!
//! With a stiff Tillotson material a small density error is a large pressure error, so children do
//! not enter the dynamics as split. Their positions relax against the density the engine's own sum
//! would read at each site in the ORIGINAL coarse field (the accepted initialization discipline:
//! Diehl et al. 2015, arXiv:1211.0525), by damped position shifting down the density-error
//! gradient, with the clock frozen: velocities, masses and internal energies are never touched.
//! The coarse exterior is held fixed as a guard band and pushes back through its own density error
//! (interface treatment per Chiron et al. 2018, JCP 354:552). RELEASE IS A DENSITY-ERROR BOUND,
//! not an iteration count: the patch releases when every child's relative density error is within
//! [`RELEASE_DENSITY_ERROR`]; a generous iteration cap exists only as a divergence guard and
//! reaching it is a stated [`Refusal`], never a silent release.
//!
//! Conservation across the relax: mass, momentum, kinetic and internal energy are exactly
//! untouched (positions are the only state written). Angular momentum drifts by at most
//! `sum_i m_i |dx_i| |v_i|` (triangle inequality over the applied shifts); the audit accumulates
//! that bound and reports it next to the actual drift.
//!
//! # Interface discipline (refusal, not smoothing-over)
//!
//! Zoom-in practice: adjacent resolution levels only, buffer shells between levels, and
//! contamination as a first-class failure (Hahn and Abel 2011, arXiv:1103.6031). One split is one
//! rung of the ladder (the icosahedron's own quantum, mass ratio 13, linear ratio 13^(1/3) = 2.35,
//! this scheme's realization of the factor-2-per-level discipline). Enforced, by refusal with a
//! stated reason rather than any quiet fix:
//!
//! - a region whose interior already spans more than one rung of mass is refused (a coarse
//!   particle inside the fine region is contamination, [`Refusal::Contaminated`]);
//! - a split whose children would interact with matter more than one rung coarser than the
//!   parents is refused until the shell is refined first ([`Refusal::RatioExceeded`]);
//! - [`contamination_check`] is the standing per-step check the future wiring runs: a coarse
//!   particle that penetrates the fine region invalidates the run and says so.
//!
//! # The validation gate (for the future end-to-end test)
//!
//! [`rim_radius_gravity_m`] and [`pi_scaling_gate`] carry Holsapple-Housen pi-group crater scaling
//! in the gravity regime (Holsapple 1993, Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. 21:333), with the
//! coefficient rows docs/59 records from the Holsapple-Housen v2.2.1 table: hard rock K1 = 0.012,
//! mu = 0.55; regolith K1 = 0.14, mu = 0.4. Factor-of-two agreement in rim size passes; when the
//! predicted crater rivals the body's own radius the gate degrades, explicitly, to an
//! order-of-magnitude sanity bound, because pi-scaling assumes a point source on a half-space.
