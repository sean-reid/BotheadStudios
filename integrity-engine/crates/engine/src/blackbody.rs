//! **Colour from temperature — Planck's law through the human eye.**
//!
//! A star's colour is not a look-up table: it is a blackbody spectrum integrated against the CIE 1931
//! colour-matching functions and converted to sRGB primaries. The catalogue gives us what was MEASURED
//! (the colour index B−V); everything visible follows from physics here, which is why `stars.bin` ships no
//! RGB. Baking colours into the asset would make the sky a picture instead of a consequence.
//!
//! This also gives the engine a real blackbody colour for the first time. The existing `incandescence`
//! ramp (a linear fade to white above 3,200 K) was built for glowing rock and cannot describe a star:
//! every star from a 3,000 K red dwarf to a 30,000 K blue giant would come out white. Retiring that ramp
//! in favour of this is a flagged follow-up — hot ejecta should glow by the same law as a star.
