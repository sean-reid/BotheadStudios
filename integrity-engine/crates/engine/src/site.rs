//! **The declared site: camera-driven materialization of ground zero** (docs/59 order-of-work
//! item 2, the trigger half, plus the entry point of item 3).
//!
//! The first production trigger for resolution-by-necessity (docs/44) driven by the CAMERA:
//! descending past the view-necessity threshold materializes the site a ground world declares (the
//! ball and a terrain patch), through the ONE conserved refinement rung (`crate::refine`,
//! split-relax-release), with the conservation ledger surfaced rather than implied. It
//! deliberately mirrors the moon-drop's resolution-distance idiom (`live_resolution_crossing` /
//! `accretion::resolution_distance`): one derived distance, one crossing check per step, so the
//! engine has one materialization pattern, not two.
//!
//! Law IV bounds the whole module: the camera changes REPRESENTATION, never existence. The site's
//! matter is declared in the world definition whether or not anyone looks; crossing the threshold
//! only changes which representation carries it, and the ledger proves the change conserved.
//!
//! # The threshold, derived (never a declared constant)
//!
//! A coarse SPH particle of mass `m` at in-situ density `rho` answers for a cube of matter
//! `s = (m/rho)^(1/3)` on a side — its share of the body, the representation's own quantum. Seen
//! from distance `d` that quantum subtends `s/d` radians. The camera's angular budget is
//! `ResolutionController::angular_resolution` (docs/49, THE one declared fidelity dial — a viewing
//! tolerance, not a physical quantity; no second dial is introduced here). The coarse
//! representation stops being able to serve the view when its quantum subtends more than the
//! budget:
//!
//! ```text
//! s / d > theta   ⟺   d < s / theta = view_resolution_distance(s, theta)
//! ```
//!
//! This is the inversion of docs/49's camera-granularity law (`camera_grain_radius = d * theta`):
//! the crossing is exactly where the grain the camera is owed becomes finer than the grain the
//! coarse field carries. For the shipped Earth statement (total mass over the same 2400-particle
//! celestial resolution the space band spends, at the outermost layer's in-situ density) the
//! threshold lands at ~9.5e8 m — inside the space band's own camera envelope, so the out-and-back
//! demo arc (fork issue: the camera path is out-AND-back) crosses it in both directions.
//!
//! When a LIVE celestial SPH field exists, the quantum is MEASURED from the field's own particles
//! (max share, biased toward resolving early per docs/44 §5); the declared statement is only the
//! answer while no field exists to measure.
//!
//! # Bidirectional, by demand
//!
//! [`SiteTrigger`] is a two-state machine fed the camera distance every frame. Below the threshold and
//! coarse: it demands Materialize. Above the threshold and resolved: it demands Deresolve. A
//! demand STANDS until the caller confirms it executed — a refused materialization (mid-event
//! field) or a refused fold (site not settled) leaves the demand in place and the refusal on
//! screen, honestly, rather than disarming the trigger.
//!
//! The downward crossing goes through the docs/61 criterion: the site folds back into the world
//! definition's summary only once its own field has been quiet for one sustained `t_q`
//! (`recohere::SettleGauge`, the ONE settling gauge). Un-settled matter stays resolved however far
//! the camera pulls back, and the HUD says so.
//!
//! # What materializes today, and what is refused for later (flagged IOUs, Law V)
//!
//! - The declared ball plus a terrain patch of the site's own strata (the body's
//!   `surface_strata` at the declared lat/lon — one Earth, no private column) split one rung
//!   through `refine::refine_patch` and released under its stated density bound. The patch is
//!   PARTICLE-form matter; meshed, standable ground at the site is docs/59 item 4.
//! - The patch budget is a declared compute statement (docs/59 names this IOU): a bowl of
//!   ground under the site, fine region 2.2 parent-spacings across (the geometry the rung's own
//!   tests verify), guard shell one interaction reach beyond, one rung of 13 — sized so the
//!   one-shot relax stays around a second of compute, far inside the 2400-particle celestial
//!   statement it rides.
//! - The relax could not RELEASE this site's patch today: ground relief at the parents' own
//!   resolution stalls the shifting at a measured ~5e-2 plateau (an order over the bound;
//!   `refine::tests::a_relief_surface_stalls_into_a_prompt_stated_refusal`). The site then
//!   carries the EXACT split with the residual stated ([`SiteRelease::Unreleased`]) — legal
//!   only because the patch enters no dynamics yet; the release gate stands between the site
//!   and any future stepping. The named deferred computation is a fringe-corrected density
//!   estimate in the rung.
//! - The 1 m grass skin is SUB-QUANTUM at this rung (a parent is ~4.5 m of basalt) and does not
//!   materialize; it needs the next rung down, exactly as recohere's sub-quantum remainder stays
//!   particles. Stated, not smoothed over.
//! - The ball materializes at its DECLARED initial position; the site's local dynamics (its fall,
//!   its rest, an impact's effect on it) are the deferred computation — the fine patch does not
//!   enter any dynamics this milestone.
//! - The ball's children are split EXACTLY but not relaxed, and the status says so: an isolated
//!   sub-resolution body has no uniform coarse environment to relax against (relaxing its 13
//!   children toward its own kernel smear in vacuum was measured divergent — the target decays
//!   to nothing as the children chase it), and the relax exists to protect entry into stiff
//!   dynamics, which the site does not do yet. The split alone conserves by construction and is
//!   audited like everything else.
//! - Energy hand-down from a live celestial field lands as the smallest honest version: a
//!   QUIESCENT field's specific internal energy is sampled at the site (mass-weighted over the
//!   particles whose support covers it) and carried into the patch; a MID-EVENT field refuses
//!   with the measured speeds stated ([`SiteRefusal::MidEvent`]) — the full mid-event hand-down
//!   (velocities, gradients, the pi-scaling gate against the live crater) is the next issue's
//!   work. Quiescence is the docs/61 law reused (`recohere::quiescent_speed`) at the coarse
//!   field's own quantum: motion that cannot buy a one-quantum rise is sub-resolution for the
//!   representation being sampled.
