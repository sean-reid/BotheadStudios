//! **The launch-window intercept: release time chosen so the site rotates under the impact.**
//!
//! A from-rest fall from lunar distance takes days of sim time while the planet turns under it,
//! so ground zero is a moving target: pressing Drop at a whim almost never lands the contact on
//! the declared site. That is correct physics and a bad control. The honest fix is the one any
//! real mission uses: never move the ball, never bend the trajectory - CHOOSE THE RELEASE TIME.
//!
//! Everything the solve needs is deterministic data the engine already holds: the N-body state,
//! the planet's declared spin (its day length and current spin angle), and the declared site
//! (lat/lon). The impact point of a fall released at time `t` is COMPUTED BY INTEGRATING THE
//! SAME LAW THE SCENE RUNS - `orbit::verlet_step` plus the swept first-contact forecast - not by
//! an analytic stand-in (the Sun's tide and the planet's own recoil bend a "radial" fall by real
//! degrees over a multi-day plunge; an unpinned formula would quietly disagree with the scene).
//!
//! What release timing can and cannot fix, stated: timing moves the site AROUND the spin axis,
//! so the solve matches the impact's AZIMUTH about that axis (the longitude of the moment). The
//! polar offset between the fall's impact ring and the site's rotation ring is set by the orbit
//! geometry alone and is reported ([`DropWindow::plane_offset_rad`]), never bent away.
