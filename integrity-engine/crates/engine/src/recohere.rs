//! **Re-coherence — the batch downward rung from a settled particle field to standable ground**
//! (docs/61).
//!
//! docs/44 §6 names demotion-on-quiescence as the cheap half of resolution-by-necessity, and the
//! docs/46 ledger (row 6) records that the de-resolution ladder's downward rungs sat without a batch
//! trigger: once an impact's excitement passes, whatever remains a particle stays a particle forever
//! — a bare ball of frozen matter where the ground should be. This module is the trigger and the
//! rung: a SETTLED region of any particle field bins back into the voxel [`World`], conserving mass
//! and material identity, and the existing surface-nets mesher then draws the result as walkable
//! ground. The mesh is only the render of the demotion; the physics here is the criterion and the
//! conservation.
//!
//! **The criterion is physical, not a frame count** (the `SETTLE_FRAMES` lesson, burned down in
//! docs/57 #4: a frame count makes the moment matter stops being matter depend on the host's step
//! rate). Both halves derive from the local gravity `g` and the field's own cell size:
//!
//! - *Quiescent speed* `v_q = sqrt(2 g Δ)`: below it a particle's kinetic energy cannot buy a
//!   one-cell rise (`½v² < gΔ`), so its remaining motion is sub-resolution — the static field and
//!   the live particle agree to within the representation's own quantum.
//! - *Sustained interval* `t_q = sqrt(2 Δ / g)`: one cell free-fall time, the region's own dynamical
//!   time at the binning resolution. Quiet for one `t_q` means nothing could have crossed a cell in
//!   the window the demotion takes effect, which is docs/44 §6's bound stated concretely.
//!
//! Neither number is a dial: change the gravity or the cell and both move as the physics says.
//!
//! **Conservation is the contract.** Mass in = voxels out × the material's own voxel quantum
//! (`ρ · Δ³`) + a remainder that STAYS particles. Matter is never deleted to lower a count, and a
//! grain's material identity survives the rung — gravel comes back as gravel voxels, never as
//! "terrain". Deposition itself goes through the ONE grain→voxel law ([`crate::matter::deposit_grain`])
//! so this rung and the per-grain settle path cannot disagree about where matter may return.
//! FLAGGED (same IOU as `Aggregate::drain_settled`): a binned grain's heat is dropped — the voxel
//! store carries no temperature yet; the remainder grains keep theirs.
