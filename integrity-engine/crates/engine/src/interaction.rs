//! **One entry point for "two things met — what does the engine do?"**
//!
//! The premise of this engine is that Theia striking proto-Earth and a raindrop striking a petal are the
//! same mechanic, differing in energy and in whether matter must be resolved — never in the rules or the
//! code path. The laws for both already existed and were both correct:
//!
//!   * how MUCH matter an interaction makes real — `damage::crater_volume`, E/σ against the struck
//!     material's own strength — which the ground scene used;
//!   * WHEN two bodies can no longer be treated as points — `accretion::resolution_distance`, from the
//!     tides — which the impact scene used.
//!
//! Neither scene knew about the other's, so a third scene would have found neither and written a third
//! path. That is how "the same mechanic implemented twice" happens: not by argument, but by a new author
//! reasonably not finding what already exists. This module is the one door, and it delegates — it does
//! not reimplement.
//!
//! **And the scenes do not walk through the door.** A scene declares which bodies exist and where; it
//! never reaches into collision, never assembles an interaction, never asks whether two things hit. The
//! ENGINE holds the bodies — their mass, radius, velocity, spin — so the engine is the one that knows a
//! collision is coming, and it is the one that prepares for it. `detect` is that owner: hand it the
//! bodies and a step, and it forecasts every imminent contact on the continuous trajectory and returns
//! the response for each. A scene that could construct an `Interaction` by hand is a scene reaching into
//! the engine's job; the engine constructs them, from what it already holds.
