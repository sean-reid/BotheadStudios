//! Phase 3 matter solver: digging, material-driven fracture, and granular settling.
//!
//! This is the **CPU, natively-tested** foundation for destructible matter. It captures the target
//! behaviors — dig a hole, break chunks off, materials respond differently *by their own strength*,
//! debris falls under real gravity and settles back into the world (matter-conserving) — without the
//! full continuum machinery. It is deliberately structured to grow toward true **MLS-MPM** (add a
//! deformation gradient + constitutive stress, then move the hot loops to WGSL); see `docs/06`/`08`.
//!
//! Fracture is emergent from data: a voxel detaches only if the tool's stress exceeds its material's
//! `fracture_strength` (from `data/materials.json`). Granite (~1.2e7 Pa) shrugs off a tool that
//! shreds soil/grass (~5e3–1.5e4 Pa) — no per-material special-casing, just the numbers.
//!
//! Scale note (same as Phase 2): the test world is asteroid-sized, so its escape velocity is a few
//! cm/s. Ejection speeds are kept sub-escape so debris stays bound and re-settles; that is correct
//! micro-gravity physics, viewed via the time-scale.
