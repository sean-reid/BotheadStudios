//! `metallic`, so the engine has zero licensing exposure. Output is high-res (512²) with a full mip
//! chain — mipmapping is the "let the client scale it down" mechanism. A material's *module* could
//! later override this with a user-supplied (e.g. CC0) image (see `docs/06`, `docs/12`).
//!
//! The look is: base albedo, modulated by tileable multi-octave value noise (grain/mottle) scaled by
//! `color_variance`, with mineral flecks, and bright sparkle specks for metals. All deterministic and
//! seamless (the lattice wraps), so textures tile across terrain without visible seams.
