//! **The engine driven by a definition** (`docs/53`) — no scene struct, no canvas, no `wasm_bindgen`.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Deleting the terrain scene (docs/50) left three built-and-verified systems with **zero** production
//! consumers — `matter::MatterSim` (the shared matter path), `resolution::ResolutionField` (docs/49's
//! camera-driven resolution) and the voxel `world::World` — while every test kept passing (docs/46
//! ledger row 15). That is docs/48's wiring pattern at its sharpest: physics wired into one place, and
//! then that place deleted.
//!
//! Robin's diagnosis: *"this is why we make the engine standalone, with external definitions."* The
//! failure was structural — capability was reachable only THROUGH a scene, so a scene's deletion took it
//! down. Here capability is reached from a `World` definition the engine loads, which is a file. Nothing
//! is orphaned by deleting a scene because no scene owns it.
//!
//! ## What it is not
//!
//! Not a renderer and not a scene. It builds the world, applies declared events through the SHARED
//! primitives, and steps. Anything that wants pixels supplies its own host — the browser today, a native
//! window later (docs/52). Keeping this headless is what makes it natively testable, which is the
//! property the scene structs never had.
