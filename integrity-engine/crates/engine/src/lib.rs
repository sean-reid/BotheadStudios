//! Integrity engine core.
//!
//! Phase 2: real Newtonian **self-gravity** from the world's aggregate voxel mass, and a rigid
//! sphere that falls under it (`F = ma`) and rests on the terrain. The layered voxel world and its
//! renderer come from Phase 1; densities in `data/materials.json` are now physically active — summed
//! voxel mass produces the gravitational field the sphere obeys.
//!
//! ## Scale & time
//! The Phase-1 test world is ~96 m across, so its real surface gravity is asteroid-scale micro-g
//! (~1e-5 m/s²) — correct physics, but far too slow to watch. `G` stays real; instead a **time
//! scale** fast-forwards the simulation for viewing (time-lapse, not fake gravity).
//!
//! ## Structure & testing
//! The pure simulation logic (materials, voxel store, mesher, gravity, body) compiles and unit-tests
//! **natively** (`cargo test`). Only the rendering/host layer is gated to the wasm target. TDD is
//! canonical for this project.

// On native builds the sim modules' only non-test consumer (the wasm renderer) is compiled out, so
// their API reads as "unused" there. The wasm build still enforces dead-code detection, and tests
// exercise them. (A future `matter-core` crate split, per docs, removes the need for this.)
