//! **The Laws, made checkable** (`docs/00`).
//!
//! The Laws are the engine's compass, and they are *available* — `CLAUDE.md` carries them, memory loads
//! them, `docs/00` states them in full. On 2026-07-21 a scene shipped that broke four of them anyway:
//! a declared `gravity_ms2: 9.81`, a second grain-interaction path, the whole patch resolved regardless
//! of necessity, and a camera clamp — all while the Laws sat in a file that had been edited that day.
//!
//! Availability is evidently not enough. This module is the part of Law-abidance a machine can hold:
//! it FAILS THE BUILD when a world file declares a quantity that must emerge from matter. Judgement
//! still belongs to the author (see the pre-flight checklist in `CLAUDE.md`), but the specific mistakes
//! already made are now caught rather than remembered.
//!
//! Test-only: it guards bytes, it does not ship any.

/// A quantity that must EMERGE from matter, and the law that says so. Declaring one in a world file is
/// Law V — a number that did not come from physics — and usually Law II as well, since the emergent
/// value already exists elsewhere and the two will drift.
