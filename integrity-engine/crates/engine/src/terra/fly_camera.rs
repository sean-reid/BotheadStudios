//! docs/43 Phase 4 — the continuous fly camera (orbit ⇄ ground). ONE camera, altitude-blended: high up it looks
//! down at the planet and a drag orbits the globe; near the ground it looks along the horizon and a drag turns the
//! view. The transition is a smoothstep on altitude, so there is no mode switch — you fly in from space to a
//! standing-on-the-ground horizon continuously (the Google-Earth feel).
//!
//! Precision: positions are kept in f64 and the whole view+projection is built in f64, cast to f32 only at the
//! very end, so ground-level framing survives the radius-1 globe (raw f32 at Earth's radius has ~0.6 m ULP). The
//! per-tile local-origin rebasing that the ground LOD needs (Phase 5) layers on top of this.
//!
//! Conventions: `lat`/`lon` in degrees (the world-file convention; `dir.y = sin(lat)`, `lon` measured from +X
//! toward +Z — the same mapping the raster sampler uses). `yaw`/`pitch` in radians (heading 0 = north, +east;
//! pitch 0 = horizon, + up, − down). Distances that enter the matrices are in DISPLAY units (`metres × ds`).
