//! docs/43 — the "world" schema: a scene defined as DATA (JSON) that the engine loads and renders. This is the
//! reusable contract (docs/43 "initial conditions + a few dials"). Two `type`s exist so far: a `"planet"` world
//! (terrain — `planet`, `surface`, `atmosphere`, a fly `camera`; consumed by `Terra`) and a `"system"` world
//! (an N-body space scene — a `bodies[]` array with orbital initial conditions, an orbit `camera`; consumed by
//! `OrbitDemo`). Optional fields default so a minimal world (`{name, planet:{radius_m}}` or `{name, bodies:[…]}`)
//! still loads. The renderer picks physics/laws by type; the file only declares initial conditions + a few dials.
