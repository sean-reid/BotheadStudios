//
// Stars are POINT sources — none of them subtends a resolvable angle from anywhere we can fly to. So the
// quad is not the star's disk; it is a point-spread function, the blur an eye or a lens puts on a point.
// Its width is fixed in PIXELS and its PEAK follows the star's measured flux, which means a bright star
// covers more pixels above the display threshold than a faint one WITHOUT anyone writing a size-vs-
// magnitude curve. Apparent size emerges from brightness, the way it does through a real instrument.
//
// "Render only what's in view" needs no special machinery here: these are ordinary primitives, so stars
// behind the camera or outside the frustum are clipped before they cost a fragment.
