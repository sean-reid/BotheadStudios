//! Self-gravitating particle aggregates — a body as a **cloud of particles held together by its own
//! gravity** (a "rubble pile"), rather than a point mass or a rigid sphere (`docs/21`).
//!
//! This is what makes celestial destruction a *simulation, not a mock*: the aggregate's cohesion and
//! (roughly spherical) shape **emerge** from mutual gravity (the representation invariant, `docs/15` —
//! roundness is emergent), and it **disrupts when given more energy than its gravitational binding
//! energy** — the particles simply exceed escape velocity and disperse. Nothing is scripted; a
//! shattered moon is the same N-body gravity that made it round, run past its binding energy.
//!
//! The particles reuse `orbit::Body` (pos, vel, mass). Gravity is **softened** (unlike the clean
//! two-body `orbit.rs`) because a dense cloud has close pairs whose bare 1/r² would explode.
//!
//! It also models a **cohesive solid** (`Aggregate::cohesive`, `docs/23`): particles held by material
//! **bonds** (Hookean spring + damper) rather than gravity — the honest way to make a metal ball *real
//! matter*. The damper dissipates energy, so a struck solid **settles to a ground state** instead of
//! ringing forever (a deterministic model reaches equilibrium); bonds **fracture** past a break strain,
//! so it **shatters emergently** under a hard impact — no scripted destroy. (The same contact-bond
//! mechanics, applied *between* surfaces, is where static-vs-kinetic friction would emerge from first
//! principles instead of two tabulated constants — a future subsystem.)
