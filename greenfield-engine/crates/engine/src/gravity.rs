//! Self-gravity from the world's aggregate matter.
//!
//! Every solid voxel has mass = its material's density × voxel volume (1 m³ ⇒ mass in kg equals
//! density). The gravitational acceleration at a point is the Newtonian sum over all that mass:
//!
//! `g(p) = Σ_i  G · m_i · (c_i − p) / |c_i − p|³`
//!
//! Summing every voxel per query would be wasteful, so we aggregate voxels into coarse blocks
//! (one mass point per block at its center of mass) — a fixed one-level approximation of the
//! Barnes–Hut idea (`docs/02`, `docs/08`). This is exact in the far field and cheap enough to
//! query many times per frame. Real `G` is used: for a small (asteroid-scale) world the field is
//! genuinely tiny — that is correct physics, not a bug.
