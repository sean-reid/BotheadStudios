# Changelog

All notable changes to `greenfield-engine` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
See [`docs/03-versioning.md`](docs/03-versioning.md) for our versioning policy — it matters
because **we are our own first customers** and pin exact engine versions in our games.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Orbital-decay control + real collision** in the space band (`docs/17`). `Brake Moon ½×` halves the
  Moon's velocity relative to Earth (a single halving still misses — real orbital mechanics), `Drop
  Moon` cancels it for a radial plunge, `Reset` restores. `orbit::resolve_contact` gives the bodies
  **surface collision** (they stop when their surfaces meet instead of tunnelling through as point
  masses); `orbit::perigee` drives a live closest-approach readout that reddens before a crash. The
  impact's energy is measured and reported (`orbit::inelastic_dissipation` vs `binding_energy`): a
  dropped Moon releases ~4.5e30 J ≈ 36× the Moon's binding energy — the HUD says plainly both bodies
  would be destroyed (actual fragmentation is future, flagged not faked). Variable **time multiplier**
  now exposed in the HUD.
- **Live real-Sun lighting + selectable focus frame** in the space band (`docs/17`). The demo now
  simulates `[Sun, Earth, Moon]` with the Earth on its true heliocentric orbit; the shader lights each
  body from the Sun's *actual position* (per-body, so phases are geometric), and the Sun — far
  off-frame at this zoom — is the light source, not a drawn disk. A focus toggle (`cycle_focus`) makes
  the viewport a physical frame of reference, re-centring on Earth or the Moon.
- **Scene picker** (`web/src/scene-nav.ts`) — a small nav injected on both pages to switch between the
  terrain slice and the space band; the scene list lives in one place.

### Changed
- **Honest space-band appearance** (`docs/17`) — removed the hardcoded ocean-blue/grey body tints
  (fudge) in favour of colour derived from a **real material composition**, aggregated by the new
  `materials::aggregate_albedo` operator (Earth = ocean water + continental rock + polar ice; Moon =
  basalt). The space shader now computes **illumination × reflectance** + Reinhard tone-map, so a
  physically dark body (basalt albedo ~0.05) reads correctly bright under a bright sun, instead of
  being faked bright. Deliberately no atmospheric "blue-marble" blue (unmodelled → not faked).

### Added
- `materials::aggregate_albedo` — the scale-relative summary operator (fraction-weighted mean albedo of
  a composition); the same reduction for any object at any zoom. Tested.
- `orbit::sun_earth_moon_system_is_bound` — a real Sun (proper mass/distance) plus the Earth's
  **appropriate heliocentric velocity**, verifying the Moon stays bound to the Earth while the Earth
  orbits the Sun (3-body, energy-conserving).
- Operating principle / candidate engine name: **"Integrity"** — every rendered value traces to
  something real or is openly flagged as a placeholder (`docs/17`).

### Changed (prior)
- **Unified awake-set dynamics** (`docs/16`) — the probe and the debris are now one system: every
  not-at-rest body feels the same gravity field and resolves contacts against the world *and each
  other*. Debris↔body impulses are momentum-conserving (a thrown clod shoves the probe; the probe
  scatters debris), settling debris never deposits inside a body (piles on it, matter conserved), and
  sleep/wake is structural (a body wakes the instant its support is removed or it's touched). Fixes the
  probe appearing to "rest on nothing" and not truly reacting to debris. New native tests cover
  momentum transfer, no-deposit-inside-body, and wake-on-unsupport.

### Notes
- **Physical-honesty debt flagged:** no atmosphere is modelled, so the per-step `DRAG` in `matter.rs`
  is a numerical stabilizer, not real air drag (documented as debt in `docs/16`).
- **Compute-budget policy** (`docs/16`): favour larger/more massive objects; massive bodies are
  budget-exempt, and debris coarsening will merge into mass-carrying clumps (conserving mass on spawn
  *and* settle) rather than dropping particles — deferred to the `docs/08` clumping work.

### Added
- **Representation invariant** (`docs/15`) — written down as canonical: *a voxel is a sampling cell,
  never a unit of matter.* The cubic grid is a coordinate lattice we sample continuous fields on (like
  pixels), not an ontology of blocks; all physical state lives on matter with continuous coordinates,
  and the grid dissolves into particles the moment physics touches it. Roundness (planets, spheres) is
  emergent from isotropic gravity, exactly as in nature — so building on a cubic lattice is not a
  foundational mistake. Also captures the "feels right in VR" corollary: behaviour is a natural
  property of the world and the object (leave it unsupported, it falls), never per-object fakery.
- **Grid-isotropy regression suite** (`crates/engine/src/isotropy.rs`) enforcing that invariant:
  gravity on a symmetric ball is radial and equal-magnitude in every direction (axes + diagonals), and
  `dig` carves a true Euclidean sphere (right volume, equal reach per axis, no lateral ejection bias).
  Each guard was verified non-vacuous by confirming it goes red under a deliberately anisotropic mutant.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-09

**Space band — you can now *watch* the Moon orbit.** The first rung of the scale-relative ladder
(`docs/13`, Step A): a spectator view of the real Earth + Moon, positioned by the validated N-body
physics from `orbit.rs` (v0.8.0). Physics runs in real SI units (f64); metres map to display units
(Earth radius → 1) only for drawing. Separate page, so the terrain slice is untouched.

### Added
- `OrbitDemo` (wasm) + `shaders/space.wgsl` — two lit spheres (ocean-blue Earth, grey Moon) with a
  directional "sun" (so you see phases), driven by `orbit::verlet_step` each frame, time-scaled so a
  full ~27.3-day orbit plays in ~20 s. HUD shows live Earth–Moon separation (hovers near 384,400 km).
- `web/orbit.html` + `web/src/orbit.ts` — camera-only host (drag orbit, pinch/wheel zoom); Vite
  multi-page build now emits both the terrain slice and the space band.
- `docs/13-scale-relative-simulation.md` — the north-star architecture (observer-relative fidelity).
- `docs/14-validation-demonstrations.md` — catalogue mapping each physics test to what it proves and
  how it becomes a visible demonstration for the full build.

### Notes
- The physics is verified natively (`orbit::moon_orbits_earth`); the *visuals* are confirmed on-device
  (headless WebGPU can't render the pipeline here). Next: Step B — refine the planet surface into the
  voxel terrain as you zoom in.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-09

**Orbital-mechanics validation (N-body).** The gravity law is now validated against real celestial
motion, not just voxel self-gravity.

### Added
- `orbit.rs` — N-body point-mass gravity with a symplectic **velocity-Verlet** integrator, plus
  energy/angular-momentum helpers. Native test: the **real Earth + Moon** (masses, 384,400 km,
  ~1.022 km/s) produce a **bound orbit** — the Moon completes ≥1 revolution, its distance stays
  within 15% of the real value, and energy + angular momentum are conserved to <1%. "If the Moon
  orbits the planet, the simulator is good" — it does.

### Notes
- Foundation for a future planet-scale demo. The validation itself needs **no rendering** (a pure
  native test), which sidesteps the headless-WebGPU limitation entirely.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Probe clipped into crater walls — looked duplicated and rested at the wrong height.** The sphere
  only collided with the terrain column directly beneath it, so near a dig it embedded in the wall
  (visible through the thin smoothed surface as a "second ball"). Replaced with proper **sphere-vs-
  voxel collision**: it's pushed out of *any* solid voxel it overlaps (floor, walls, corners), with
  restitution + friction. Solid objects act solid now. Native tests: rests on a voxel floor without
  penetrating; doesn't clip into a wall.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 6 fixes** (from an iPad play-test).

### Fixed
- **Terrain was hollow / open on some sides.** Surface Nets had only one cell of boundary padding, so
  the outer walls sat at the grid edge where closing quads can't form → holes. Padded by two cells;
  new `surface_nets_mesh_is_closed` test verifies the mesh is **watertight** (0 boundary edges).
- **"Eroded cubes" / poor shading.** Feed Surface Nets a **smoothed** (box-blurred) occupancy field so
  the iso-surface rounds properly, and use its own **consistently-outward** normals (a binary field's
  gradient is blocky and my geometry-normal recompute could invert walls).
- **Long-press blast "grew" mounds.** Debris used a center-of-mass gravity approximation that pulls
  off-center matter inward, so it drifted to the middle and piled up. Debris now uses the **full**
  aggregated field (near-straight-down on the slab); the field is coarsened (block 8) to keep the
  per-particle queries cheap.

### Added
- `web/screenshot.mjs` — a headless-Chromium (Playwright) visual-check harness for verifying the
  WebGPU render. Needs GPU render-node access; without it, Chromium falls back to software (SwiftShader),
  which can't run the texture-array pipeline.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 6 — smooth surface meshing.** Terrain and craters render as smooth surfaces instead of
Minecraft-style cubes. The voxel grid stays the physics substrate; only the *visual* changes.

### Added
- `mesher::build_surface_nets` — Surface Nets (via the `fast-surface-nets` crate) over the voxel
  occupancy field, with **smooth normals recomputed from the geometry** (the binary field's own
  gradient is blocky) and oriented outward. Each vertex is tagged with the nearest solid voxel's
  material, so triplanar texturing (Phase 4) and specular shine still apply. Native-tested (valid,
  finite, and genuinely smooth — non-axis-aligned normals).
- The renderer uses it for the initial terrain and every dig re-mesh. The blocky `build` mesher is
  kept as a reference/fallback.

### Notes
- Sim/visual decoupling: physics (mass, gravity, fracture, collapse) is unchanged — the world is
  still "voxels all the way down"; the renderer just presents it smoothly.
- Binary field ⇒ mildly-rounded geometry + smooth shading. Further realism (a smoothed/SDF field for
  rounder geometry, normal maps, finer debris) is future work.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 5 — structural collapse.** Matter that a dig undercuts or isolates no longer floats: anything
not connected to the ground falls. Removes the Phase-3 "floating voxels" limitation.

### Added
- `world.find_unsupported()` — flood-fill from the anchored base (`y = 0`); returns every solid voxel
  not connected to it (6-connectivity). Handles overhangs, undercuts, and blasted-off chunks uniformly.
- `MatterSim::collapse()` — detaches unsupported voxels into falling particles (from rest); one pass
  suffices (the remainder is fully supported). Triggered after every dig.
- Native tests: intact terrain has zero unsupported voxels; an isolated voxel collapses, conserves
  matter, and re-settles into the grid.

### Notes
- Collapse is O(voxels) per edit (a user action, not per-frame). If a collapse would exceed the
  particle budget it caps (a few voxels may remain floating) — noted as a bound, not a silent drop.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 4 — emergent textures.** Completes the vertical-slice roadmap. Materials get a distinct look
generated *from their own physical properties* — no bundled image files, zero licensing exposure.

### Added
- `texture.rs` — procedural texture generator: high-res (512²) RGBA with a full mip chain, synthesized
  from `albedo` + `color_variance` + `metallic` (grain/mottle from tileable multi-octave noise,
  mineral flecks, metal sparkle specks). Seamless (wrapping lattice). Native tests: size + mip chain,
  mean color tracks albedo, materials differ, non-flat variation.
- World shader: **triplanar** sampling of a per-material procedural texture array (no UVs), plus a
  **specular highlight (shine)** driven by per-material `roughness`/`metallic` (metals get a tighter,
  tinted highlight). Material id per vertex; the probe renders as textured iron.
- `materials.rs` loads `roughness`/`metallic`/`color_variance`. HUD adds an **FPS** counter.
- `docs/12` — texture approach + verified CC0 sources (ambientCG/Poly Haven) for optional
  user-supplied real textures via the module system.

### Notes
- Mipmapping is the "client can scale it down" mechanism; `TEX_SIZE` is one constant to raise for
  more detail. The engine bundles **no images** — a material *module* may later drop in a CC0 photo.
- This closes the initial Phase 0–4 vertical slice: layered voxel matter · self-gravity · dig &
  fracture · emergent texture — all from the cited material database.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 3 — dig & material-driven fracture.** Click to dig; matter breaks apart according to each
material's own strength, falls under gravity, and settles back into the world.

### Added
- `matter.rs` — CPU matter solver: spherical dig via voxel raycast; a voxel detaches into a particle
  only if the tool's stress exceeds its material's `fracture_strength` (granite resists a tool that
  shreds soil/grass — no per-material special-casing, just the numbers). Debris falls under the
  Phase-2 field and, on rest, deposits back into the voxel grid (piling; matter-conserving). Native
  tests: soft-vs-hard selectivity, and matter conservation through dig + settle.
- `world.rs` — voxel raycast (Amanatides–Woo DDA) for picking, `set_voxel`, `solid_count`.
- `materials.rs` — loads `fracture_strength` (tensile strength, falling back to cohesion).
- Renderer — instanced debris cubes (`particles.wgsl`), terrain re-mesh on edit; HUD shows debris
  count. Controls: **click** to dig soil/grass, **shift-click** to blast rock.

### Notes
- This is the CPU-tested **foundation** for full continuum MLS-MPM, not the full method yet — it
  delivers dig/fracture/granular behavior emergent from material data. MLS-MPM (deformation gradient +
  constitutive stress, then a WGSL port) is the planned evolution (`docs/06`/`08`).
- Micro-gravity again: ejection is capped below the world's ~7 cm/s escape velocity so debris stays
  bound and re-settles (correct physics, viewed via the time-scale).
- Digging a mid-column hole can leave voxels above "floating" — structural collapse is future work.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 2 — self-gravity & the falling probe.** Density stops being decorative and starts doing
physics: the world's summed voxel mass produces a real Newtonian gravitational field, and a sphere
falls under it (`F = ma`) and rests on the surface.

### Added
- `gravity.rs` — aggregate voxel-mass gravity field (voxels lumped into blocks; direct-sum
  `g(p) = ΣG·mᵢ·(cᵢ−p)/|cᵢ−p|³`, f64 accumulation). Native tests: point-mass `G·M/r²`, far-field,
  mass conservation.
- `body.rs` — rigid sphere integrated with semi-implicit Euler under the field, with ground contact,
  restitution/friction, and a scale-relative rest threshold (works from Earth-g to micro-g). Native
  tests: free-fall kinematics, fall-and-rest.
- Renderer draws the probe (a second mesh with a per-object model matrix); live HUD shows world mass,
  local gravity, probe altitude/speed, rest state, and time-scale. Controls: `Space`/`R` re-drop,
  `[`/`]` time-scale.
- End-to-end native test: the probe falls toward the generated world and rests on it.

### Notes
- Real `G` is used, so the ~96 m test world has asteroid-scale micro-g (~1e-5 m/s²) — correct
  physics. A **time-scale** (default 250×) fast-forwards the sim for viewing; it is time-lapse, not
  amplified gravity.
- The probe is hand-integrated (one body); Rapier is deferred until many bodies / arbitrary contacts
  justify it. The rendered sphere is enlarged for visibility (free-fall is size/mass-independent).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 1 — layered voxel world.** The cited material data becomes a rendered, orbitable world.

### Added
- `data/materials.json` — 19 cited materials (density, moduli, strengths, hardness, albedo, …) as
  the physical single source of truth (`docs/04`).
- Engine sim modules (natively unit-tested): `materials` (loads the database), `world` (chunked
  voxel store + layered rock/dirt/grass generator with a value-noise heightfield, using real
  densities), `mesher` (face-culling mesh, per-material albedo colors).
- Real 3D renderer: depth buffer, perspective orbit camera, directional + hemispheric lighting;
  `Engine.set_orbit(yaw, pitch, zoom)`. Host adds drag-to-orbit / scroll-to-zoom.
- `cargo test` suite (material load, layer ordering, mesh validity) — TDD is canonical; wgpu/wasm
  code is gated to the wasm target so the sim logic tests natively.
- Design docs `05`–`10`: Postgres→JSON data pipeline, material modules, taxonomy/finishes/object
  composition, adaptive clumping/LOD, agentic authoring + interaction, and robustness principles.
- CI: fmt + clippy + native tests + wasm build on every push.

### Notes
- Face-culling (blocky) mesher for now; smooth surface-nets meshing is a planned upgrade.
- Density is stored per material but not yet physically active — it drives self-gravity in Phase 2.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-08

First milestone: **Phase 0 — scaffold & first pixel.** The full Rust → WASM → `wgpu` → canvas
pipeline is live, driven by a thin Vite/TypeScript host.

### Added
- Cargo workspace with the `engine` crate (`cdylib` + `rlib`) compiled to WASM via `wasm-pack`.
- `Engine` WASM API: `Engine.create(canvas)`, `render()`, `resize(w, h)` — a `wgpu` WebGPU
  device that clears the canvas with a pulsing color each frame.
- Vite + TypeScript host (`web/`) that loads the WASM, sizes the canvas, and pumps
  `requestAnimationFrame`, with a graceful "WebGPU unavailable" message.
- Project meta: MIT license, `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `JOURNAL`, this changelog, and two
  research reports under `docs/` surveying prior art and reusable OSS building blocks.

### Notes
- Pinned to `wgpu` 24.0.5. WebGPU-only backend to keep the WASM small.
- **Public API is unstable** while we're pre-1.0 (see versioning policy).
