# Changelog

All notable changes to `greenfield-engine` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
See [`docs/03-versioning.md`](docs/03-versioning.md) for our versioning policy — it matters
because **we are our own first customers** and pin exact engine versions in our games.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 4 — emergent textures.** Completes the vertical-slice roadmap. Materials get a distinct look
generated *from their own physical properties* — no bundled image files, zero licensing exposure.

### Added
- `texture.rs` — procedural texture generator: high-res (512²) RGBA with a full mip chain, synthesized
  from `albedo` + `color_variance` + `metallic` (grain/mottle from tileable multi-octave noise,
  mineral flecks, metal sparkle specks). Seamless (wrapping lattice). Native tests: size + mip chain,
  mean color tracks albedo, materials differ, non-flat variation.
- World shader: **triplanar** sampling of a per-material procedural texture array (no UVs), plus a
  **specular highlight (shine)** driven by per-material `roughness`/`metallic` (metals get a tighter,
  tinted highlight). Material id per vertex; the probe renders as textured iron.
- `materials.rs` loads `roughness`/`metallic`/`color_variance`. HUD adds an **FPS** counter.
- `docs/12` — texture approach + verified CC0 sources (ambientCG/Poly Haven) for optional
  user-supplied real textures via the module system.

### Notes
- Mipmapping is the "client can scale it down" mechanism; `TEX_SIZE` is one constant to raise for
  more detail. The engine bundles **no images** — a material *module* may later drop in a CC0 photo.
- This closes the initial Phase 0–4 vertical slice: layered voxel matter · self-gravity · dig &
  fracture · emergent texture — all from the cited material database.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 3 — dig & material-driven fracture.** Click to dig; matter breaks apart according to each
material's own strength, falls under gravity, and settles back into the world.

### Added
- `matter.rs` — CPU matter solver: spherical dig via voxel raycast; a voxel detaches into a particle
  only if the tool's stress exceeds its material's `fracture_strength` (granite resists a tool that
  shreds soil/grass — no per-material special-casing, just the numbers). Debris falls under the
  Phase-2 field and, on rest, deposits back into the voxel grid (piling; matter-conserving). Native
  tests: soft-vs-hard selectivity, and matter conservation through dig + settle.
- `world.rs` — voxel raycast (Amanatides–Woo DDA) for picking, `set_voxel`, `solid_count`.
- `materials.rs` — loads `fracture_strength` (tensile strength, falling back to cohesion).
- Renderer — instanced debris cubes (`particles.wgsl`), terrain re-mesh on edit; HUD shows debris
  count. Controls: **click** to dig soil/grass, **shift-click** to blast rock.

### Notes
- This is the CPU-tested **foundation** for full continuum MLS-MPM, not the full method yet — it
  delivers dig/fracture/granular behavior emergent from material data. MLS-MPM (deformation gradient +
  constitutive stress, then a WGSL port) is the planned evolution (`docs/06`/`08`).
- Micro-gravity again: ejection is capped below the world's ~7 cm/s escape velocity so debris stays
  bound and re-settles (correct physics, viewed via the time-scale).
- Digging a mid-column hole can leave voxels above "floating" — structural collapse is future work.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 2 — self-gravity & the falling probe.** Density stops being decorative and starts doing
physics: the world's summed voxel mass produces a real Newtonian gravitational field, and a sphere
falls under it (`F = ma`) and rests on the surface.

### Added
- `gravity.rs` — aggregate voxel-mass gravity field (voxels lumped into blocks; direct-sum
  `g(p) = ΣG·mᵢ·(cᵢ−p)/|cᵢ−p|³`, f64 accumulation). Native tests: point-mass `G·M/r²`, far-field,
  mass conservation.
- `body.rs` — rigid sphere integrated with semi-implicit Euler under the field, with ground contact,
  restitution/friction, and a scale-relative rest threshold (works from Earth-g to micro-g). Native
  tests: free-fall kinematics, fall-and-rest.
- Renderer draws the probe (a second mesh with a per-object model matrix); live HUD shows world mass,
  local gravity, probe altitude/speed, rest state, and time-scale. Controls: `Space`/`R` re-drop,
  `[`/`]` time-scale.
- End-to-end native test: the probe falls toward the generated world and rests on it.

### Notes
- Real `G` is used, so the ~96 m test world has asteroid-scale micro-g (~1e-5 m/s²) — correct
  physics. A **time-scale** (default 250×) fast-forwards the sim for viewing; it is time-lapse, not
  amplified gravity.
- The probe is hand-integrated (one body); Rapier is deferred until many bodies / arbitrary contacts
  justify it. The rendered sphere is enlarged for visibility (free-fall is size/mass-independent).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-08

**Phase 1 — layered voxel world.** The cited material data becomes a rendered, orbitable world.

### Added
- `data/materials.json` — 19 cited materials (density, moduli, strengths, hardness, albedo, …) as
  the physical single source of truth (`docs/04`).
- Engine sim modules (natively unit-tested): `materials` (loads the database), `world` (chunked
  voxel store + layered rock/dirt/grass generator with a value-noise heightfield, using real
  densities), `mesher` (face-culling mesh, per-material albedo colors).
- Real 3D renderer: depth buffer, perspective orbit camera, directional + hemispheric lighting;
  `Engine.set_orbit(yaw, pitch, zoom)`. Host adds drag-to-orbit / scroll-to-zoom.
- `cargo test` suite (material load, layer ordering, mesh validity) — TDD is canonical; wgpu/wasm
  code is gated to the wasm target so the sim logic tests natively.
- Design docs `05`–`10`: Postgres→JSON data pipeline, material modules, taxonomy/finishes/object
  composition, adaptive clumping/LOD, agentic authoring + interaction, and robustness principles.
- CI: fmt + clippy + native tests + wasm build on every push.

### Notes
- Face-culling (blocky) mesher for now; smooth surface-nets meshing is a planned upgrade.
- Density is stored per material but not yet physically active — it drives self-gravity in Phase 2.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-08

First milestone: **Phase 0 — scaffold & first pixel.** The full Rust → WASM → `wgpu` → canvas
pipeline is live, driven by a thin Vite/TypeScript host.

### Added
- Cargo workspace with the `engine` crate (`cdylib` + `rlib`) compiled to WASM via `wasm-pack`.
- `Engine` WASM API: `Engine.create(canvas)`, `render()`, `resize(w, h)` — a `wgpu` WebGPU
  device that clears the canvas with a pulsing color each frame.
- Vite + TypeScript host (`web/`) that loads the WASM, sizes the canvas, and pumps
  `requestAnimationFrame`, with a graceful "WebGPU unavailable" message.
- Project meta: MIT license, `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `JOURNAL`, this changelog, and two
  research reports under `docs/` surveying prior art and reusable OSS building blocks.

### Notes
- Pinned to `wgpu` 24.0.5. WebGPU-only backend to keep the WASM small.
- **Public API is unstable** while we're pre-1.0 (see versioning policy).
